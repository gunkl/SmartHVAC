# Thermal Model v3 — Territory Spec (Tier 3)

## Anchors

| Question | Short answer (≤2 sentences) | → Full answer |
|---|---|---|
| What triggers a `passive_decay` observation and what does it measure? | Starts when HVAC off, fan off, windows closed, and `\|T_indoor − T_outdoor\| ≥ 3°F`; measures `k_passive` (envelope decay rate, hr⁻¹, always negative). Requires 30 samples minimum (long-window path) or 5 samples (rolling-window path). | [§Observation Types](#observation-types) |
| When does the gate bridge activate and what does it do? | Activates when `k_passive is None OR confidence_k_passive == "none"` AND `k_vent_window` is not None and `≤ 0`. Promotes `k_vent_window` as a proxy `k_passive` so physics prediction can run on bridge-only homes without a data wipe. | [§Gate Bridge](#gate-bridge) |
| What are the three rolling-window thresholds and what happens at each? | `THERMAL_ROLLING_MIN_WINDOW_MINUTES` (30 min): earliest commit attempt; `THERMAL_ROLLING_MAX_WINDOW_MINUTES` (240 min): hard cap — commit or abandon regardless of signal; signal check (`THERMAL_ROLLING_MIN_DELTA_T_F = 0.2°F`): required indoor ΔT to commit between the two limits. | [§Rolling Window Constraints](#rolling-window-constraints) |
| How does `compute_k_passive` reject an observation and what codes does it emit? | Five rejection codes: `REJECT_TOO_FEW_SAMPLES`, `REJECT_SMALL_DELTA` (Σδ² = 0), `REJECT_OLS_WRONG_SIGN` (k > 0), `REJECT_OLS_BOUNDS` (k outside [-0.5, -0.001]), `REJECT_OLS_BAD_FIT` (R² < 0.20). Exactly one of `k_passive` or `rejection_code` is non-None in the return tuple. | [§OLS Functions — compute\_k\_passive](#compute_k_passive) |
| What invariant must hold for every committed observation's `k_passive`? | `k_passive < 0` for all non-bridge envelope modes; `k_solar ≥ 0` for all committed solar observations. The bridge proxy (`k_vent_window`) may equal 0.0 exactly (perfectly inert home) but never > 0. | [§Invariants](#invariants) |
| How does `ventilated_decay` commit path choose between 1-param and 2-param OLS? | When solar factor range across samples ≥ 0.30, the 2-param path fires first and — if bounds pass — commits both `k_env` and `k_solar`, bypassing 1-param entirely. If 2-param fails bounds/R², the 1-param path runs as fallback. | [§OLS Functions — compute\_k\_env\_solar](#compute_k_env_solar) |
| What is the EWMA alpha for each confidence grade and which observation types write `k_passive`? | Alpha: high = 0.30, medium = 0.15, low = 0.05. Only `passive`, `heat`, and `cool` modes write `k_passive`; `fan_only` writes `k_vent`; `ventilated` writes `k_vent_window`; `solar` writes `k_solar`. | [§EWMA Update](#ewma-update-_update_thermal_model_cache) |
| How does the dual-estimator framework select between endpoint and block-averaged OLS per overnight window? | Both estimators always run; an 8-row decision table selects based on R²_B and 30% relative agreement. On disagreement, Estimator A (endpoint) wins. On R²_B ≥ 0.50 and agreement, B wins with medium grade (α=0.15). | [§Dual Estimator Framework](#dual-estimator-framework) |
| Where is the solar factor formula defined and what does `phase_offset_h` do? | `_solar_factor(local_hour, phase_offset_h)` shifts the sinusoidal solar input peak by `phase_offset_h` hours. With the default offset=2 the peak falls at local hour 15 (3pm) instead of 13 (1pm). | [§Solar Factor](#solar-factor) |
| How is `solar_phase_offset_h` learned from chart_log? | Daytime passive windows (HVAC off, fan off, windows closed) are scanned for the indoor temperature peak hour. `phase_obs = peak_hour − 13` is accumulated via EWMA (α=0.10), clamped to [0, 4]. | [§Solar Phase Offset Learning](#solar-phase-offset-learning) |
| What is engine visibility and where is it exposed? | `get_engine_status()` returns per-engine `active`, `value`, and `since` fields; `k_passive` and `k_solar` additionally include `confidence` and `obs_count`. Exposed at REST `/api/climate_advisor/engines`, dashboard Debug tab, AI investigator context, and `tools/engine_status.py`. | [§Engine Visibility](#engine-visibility) |

## Observation Types

All six types run concurrently in `_pending_observations: dict[str, PendingObservation]`. The dict is keyed by the `OBS_TYPE_*` string constant.

| obs_type | Trigger conditions | Target parameter(s) | Min samples (long-window path) | Can run concurrently with? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hvac_heat` | `hvac_action = "heating"` transitions to active | `k_active_heat`, `k_passive` (via pre-heat buffer) | 4 post-heat samples (`THERMAL_MIN_POST_HEAT_SAMPLES`) | Nothing HVAC; all passive types commit/abandon on HVAC start |
| `hvac_cool` | `hvac_action = "cooling"` transitions to active | `k_active_cool`, `k_passive` | 4 post-heat samples | Same as hvac_heat |
| `passive_decay` | HVAC off, fan off, windows closed, `\|T_indoor − T_outdoor\| ≥ THERMAL_PASSIVE_MIN_DELTA_F (3.0°F)` | `k_passive` | 30 (`THERMAL_PASSIVE_MIN_SAMPLES`) | `fan_only_decay`, `ventilated_decay`, `solar_gain` — but mutual exclusion via trigger conditions prevents concurrent passive + fan or passive + vent |
| `fan_only_decay` | Fan active (`_fan_active` or thermostat `fan_only` state), HVAC off, no open sensors | `k_vent` | 15 (`THERMAL_FAN_MIN_SAMPLES`) | `solar_gain` is not started while fan is active |
| `ventilated_decay` | Any door/window sensor open, HVAC off, `\|T_indoor − T_outdoor\| ≥ THERMAL_VENTILATED_MIN_DELTA_F (1.0°F)` | `k_vent_window` (and optionally `k_solar` via 2-param path) | 20 (`THERMAL_VENT_MIN_SAMPLES`) | Can coexist with anything not HVAC; but fan trigger and sensor-open trigger are mutually exclusive |
| `solar_gain` | HVAC off, fan off, windows closed, `T_indoor > T_outdoor`, daytime (local 08:00–18:00, `THERMAL_SOLAR_DAYTIME_START_H` / `END_H`) | `k_solar` | 20 (`THERMAL_SOLAR_MIN_SAMPLES`) | `passive_decay` may also be running (different parameter) |

**HVAC contamination rule:** When HVAC starts (`_start_hvac_observation()`), all four non-HVAC types in `_pending_observations` are committed via `_commit_observation_if_sufficient()` (which commits if `len(samples) >= min_samples`, else abandons). The contamination check fires before the new HVAC observation is started.

---

## Observation Lifecycle

### State Machine

```
(start trigger fires)
        ↓
   status = "monitoring"
        ↓
   samples accumulate via _sample_all_observations()
        ↓
   ┌─── commit condition ────┐    ┌─── abandon condition ───┐
   │ status → "committing"   │    │ popped from dict         │
   │ _commit_observation()   │    │ rejection_log appended   │
   │ → COMMITTED             │    │ → ABANDONED              │
   └─────────────────────────┘    └──────────────────────────┘
```

Terminal states: committed (observation recorded in `thermal_observations`) or abandoned (rejection event logged in `rejection_log`). No re-entry once a type is removed from `_pending_observations`.

### Rolling Decay Types (passive_decay, fan_only_decay, ventilated_decay, solar_gain)

**Start:** `_start_decay_observation(obs_type)` fires from Section B of `_sample_all_observations()` when trigger conditions are first met. Creates the observation dict with `status="monitoring"`, empty `samples`, and `flags_at_start`.

**Sample accumulation:** Section A of `_sample_all_observations()` iterates all monitoring observations. Each type has a per-type decimation gate:

| Type | Gate constant | Interval |
|---|---|---|
| `passive_decay` | `THERMAL_PASSIVE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S` | 5 min |
| `fan_only_decay` | `THERMAL_FAN_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S` | 2 min |
| `ventilated_decay` | `THERMAL_PASSIVE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S` | 5 min |
| `solar_gain` | `THERMAL_SOLAR_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S` | 5 min |

A sample is appended only when `elapsed_since_last_sample >= interval_s`. Each sample is a dict with `timestamp`, `indoor_temp_f`, `outdoor_temp_f`, `elapsed_minutes`. For `ventilated_decay`, `solar_factor` (from `_solar_factor(now.hour)`) is also recorded at collection time. The hard cap per observation is `THERMAL_MAX_OBS_SAMPLES = 200`.

**Commit decision (`_evaluate_rolling_window`):** Called from Section C for each rolling type. Two-threshold logic:

1. `elapsed < THERMAL_ROLLING_MIN_WINDOW_MINUTES (30)` AND signal not sufficient → keep collecting (return `False`)
2. `elapsed >= THERMAL_ROLLING_MIN_WINDOW_MINUTES` AND `signal_sufficient=True` → commit via `_commit_rolling_window_obs()`
3. `elapsed >= THERMAL_ROLLING_MAX_WINDOW_MINUTES (240)` → commit if `len(samples) >= THERMAL_MIN_DECAY_SAMPLES + 1 (= 5)`, else abandon with reason `"max_window_exceeded"`
4. Between min and max, signal not sufficient → log and keep alive (samples trimmed to last 96 if > 96)

**Solar keep-alive guard (ventilated_decay only):** During daytime hours (08:00–18:00), if `sf_range < THERMAL_SOLAR_FACTOR_MIN_RANGE (0.30)`, `_vent_signal_sufficient` is forced to `False`, suppressing early commit even after the 30-min minimum. This prevents a 1-param commit before the 2-param OLS can distinguish `k_env` from `k_solar`. The 240-min hard cap overrides the guard.

**Hard cap behavior:** When `elapsed >= THERMAL_ROLLING_MAX_WINDOW_MINUTES`, `_evaluate_rolling_window` commits unconditionally (with `skip_delta_guard=True`) if `len(samples) >= 5`, otherwise abandons with `reason_code="max_window_exceeded"`.

### HVAC Types (hvac_heat, hvac_cool)

**Start:** `_start_hvac_observation(session_mode)` fires when `hvac_action` changes to `"heating"` or `"cooling"`. Creates the observation with `_phase="active"`, `active_samples=[]`, `pre_heat_samples` from the `_pre_heat_sample_buffer`, and `status="monitoring"`.

**Sample accumulation:** Active phase samples every coordinator poll (no decimation gate). Post-heat phase uses `THERMAL_HVAC_POST_HEAT_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S` (5 min). Post-heat samples go into `post_heat_samples`.

**Active → post_heat transition:** `_end_hvac_active_phase(obs_type)` fires when `hvac_action` leaves `"heating"`/`"cooling"`. Sets `_phase="post_heat"`, records `active_end`, computes `session_minutes`.

**Commit decision (`_check_hvac_stabilization`):** Minimum post-heat samples before commit attempt:
- No proxy: `THERMAL_MIN_POST_HEAT_SAMPLES = 4`
- Proxy available (`k_vent_window < 0` in cache): 1 sample

Plateau guard (non-proxy path only): requires `peak_indoor_f − end_indoor_f >= THERMAL_HVAC_MIN_DECAY_F (0.3°F)`. If not met, abandons with reason `"plateau guard: insufficient post-heat decay"`.

When commit conditions are met, `obs["status"] = "stabilized"` is set and `_commit_observation(obs_type)` is called.

Post-heat timeout: if `elapsed_post > THERMAL_POST_HEAT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES (45)`, the observation is abandoned.

## OLS Functions

### compute_k_passive()

**Signature:** `compute_k_passive(post_samples, pre_samples=None, min_samples=None) -> tuple[float | None, float, str | None]`

**Input:** `post_samples` — list of sample dicts (mandatory). `pre_samples` — optional pre-heat buffer samples processed as a separate window to avoid spurious rates at the pre→post boundary. `min_samples` — overrides the OLS floor (default: `THERMAL_MIN_POST_HEAT_SAMPLES = 4`; pass `THERMAL_MIN_DECAY_SAMPLES = 4` for rolling-window decay types).

**Pre-condition:** `total_samples = len(post_samples) + len(pre_samples) >= min_samples + 1`

**Computation:** 1-param OLS forced through origin:
```
k = Σ(rate_i × delta_i) / Σ(delta_i²)
```
where for each consecutive sample pair `(i, i+1)`:
- `rate_i = (T_indoor[i+1] − T_indoor[i]) / dt_hours`
- `delta_i = midpoint(T_indoor) − midpoint(T_outdoor)` over the interval
- `T_indoor` values are first passed through a 3-sample centered moving average (`_smooth_temps`) to reduce 1°F quantisation noise; edge samples are unchanged

Each pre/post window is processed independently. Pairs are built within each window only (no cross-boundary pairs).

**R² formula (forced-through-origin model):**
```
R² = 1 − SS_res / SS_tot
where SS_res = Σ(rate_i − k × delta_i)²
      SS_tot = Σ(rate_i²)
```
R² is clamped to [0.0, ∞).

**Rejection codes (in evaluation order):**

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `REJECT_TOO_FEW_SAMPLES` | `len(rates) < min_samples` after building pairs |
| `REJECT_SMALL_DELTA` | `Σ(delta_i²) == 0` (all indoor/outdoor differentials are zero) |
| `REJECT_OLS_WRONG_SIGN` | `k > 0` (physics requires negative k for passive cooling toward outdoor) |
| `REJECT_OLS_BOUNDS` | `k` outside `[THERMAL_K_PASSIVE_MIN (-0.5), THERMAL_K_PASSIVE_MAX (-0.001)]` |
| `REJECT_OLS_BAD_FIT` | `R² < THERMAL_MIN_R_SQUARED (0.20)` |

**Post-condition:** Returns `(k_passive, r_squared, rejection_code)`. Exactly one of `k_passive` or `rejection_code` is non-None. On success: `k_passive < 0`, `rejection_code = None`. On failure: `k_passive = None`, `rejection_code` is one of the `REJECT_*` constants, `r_squared` is the computed value (may be 0.0 if OLS never ran).

---

### compute_k_passive_blocks()

**Signature:** `compute_k_passive_blocks(window_entries, block_minutes=60, min_blocks=6) -> tuple[float | None, float, str | None]`

**Input:** `window_entries` — list of chart_log entry dicts with fields `ts` (ISO-8601 string), `indoor` (float, °F), `outdoor` (float, °F). These are raw chart_log entries at ~30-minute cadence, not 5-min thermostat samples.

**Purpose:** Block-averaged OLS for k_passive using the nightly chart_log window. Averaging 30-min entries into 60-min blocks reduces quantization noise via CLT: from ±1°F raw to ±0.71°F per block (√(1/2) × 1°F). This produces R² of 0.5–0.8 on clean nights vs. ≈0.02 for raw 5-min consecutive-pair OLS.

**Algorithm:**
1. Compute elapsed minutes per entry from the first entry's `ts`.
2. Group entries into 60-min blocks by `floor(elapsed_min / block_minutes)`. Skip any block with fewer than 2 entries.
3. Per usable block: compute mean `indoor`, mean `outdoor`, mean elapsed_min.
4. If usable blocks < `min_blocks` (6): return `(None, 0.0, REJECT_TOO_FEW_BLOCKS)`.
5. Build synthetic sample dicts `{"indoor_temp_f": ..., "outdoor_temp_f": ..., "elapsed_minutes": ...}` from block means.
6. Call `compute_k_passive(synthetic_samples, min_samples=min_blocks - 1)` and return its result directly.

**Rejection codes:**

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `REJECT_TOO_FEW_BLOCKS` | Usable blocks (≥2 entries each) < `min_blocks` (6) |
| `REJECT_TOO_FEW_SAMPLES` | Delegated from `compute_k_passive` on the synthetic samples |
| `REJECT_OLS_WRONG_SIGN` | Delegated from `compute_k_passive` |
| `REJECT_OLS_BOUNDS` | Delegated from `compute_k_passive` |
| `REJECT_OLS_BAD_FIT` | Delegated from `compute_k_passive` (R² < 0.20) |

**Post-condition:** Same as `compute_k_passive`: `(k_passive, r_squared, rejection_code)`. Exactly one of `k_passive` or `rejection_code` is non-None.

---

### compute_k_env_solar()

**Signature:** `compute_k_env_solar(samples, min_samples=4) -> tuple[float | None, float | None, float | None]`

**Input:** `samples` — list of sample dicts with `indoor_temp_f`, `outdoor_temp_f`, `elapsed_minutes`, `solar_factor`. Consecutive pairs are used.

**Pre-condition:** `len(pairs) >= min_samples` (4 by default) AND `sf_range = max(sfs) − min(sfs) >= THERMAL_SOLAR_FACTOR_MIN_RANGE (0.30)`.

**Computation:** 2-param OLS via 2×2 normal equations (no scipy):
```
[x1x1  x1x2] [k_env  ]   [x1y]
[x1x2  x2x2] [k_solar] = [x2y]

where:
  x1 = delta_i = midpoint(T_in − T_out)
  x2 = sf_i = midpoint(solar_factor)
  y  = rate_i = (T_in[i+1] − T_in[i]) / dt_hours
```
Solved as:
```
det = x1x1 * x2x2 − x1x2²
k_env   = (x2x2 * x1y − x1x2 * x2y) / det
k_solar = (x1x1 * x2y − x1x2 * x1y) / det
```

**R² (mean-centered, 2-param):**
```
R² = 1 − Σ(rate_i − k_env×delta_i − k_solar×sf_i)² / Σ(rate_i − mean_rate)²
```

**Fallback conditions (returns `(None, None, None)`):**
- Fewer than `min_samples` pairs
- `sf_range < THERMAL_SOLAR_FACTOR_MIN_RANGE` — insufficient solar variation for 2-param separation (returns without emitting a rejection code; caller falls back to 1-param)
- `abs(det) < 1e-12` — numerical near-singular matrix
- Bounds fail or R² below threshold — rejection handled by caller (`_commit_event_from_dict`) which falls through to 1-param

**Accepted bounds (checked in `_commit_event_from_dict`):**
- `k_env` in `[THERMAL_K_PASSIVE_MIN (-0.5), 0.001]`
- `k_solar` in `[0.0, THERMAL_K_SOLAR_MAX_F_PER_HR (8.0)]`
- `R² >= THERMAL_MIN_R_SQUARED (0.20)`

**Post-condition:** Returns `(k_env, k_solar, r_squared)` on success, or `(None, None, None)` on any failure. Note: does not emit a `REJECT_*` string — the `None` tuple is the failure signal.

---

## Commit Routing (_commit_event_from_dict)

`_commit_event_from_dict(event, force_grade, obs_type)` selects the commit path based on `obs_type`. Returns `(obs_dict | None, reject_code | None, r_squared | None)`.

| obs_type | Commit path | Cache keys written by `_update_thermal_model_cache` | `hvac_mode` tag in committed obs dict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `passive_decay` | 1-param OLS (`compute_k_passive`) on `event["samples"]`; min `THERMAL_MIN_DECAY_SAMPLES (4)` | `k_passive`, `avg_r_squared_passive`, `observation_count_passive` | `"passive"` |
| `fan_only_decay` | 1-param OLS on `event["samples"]` | `k_vent`, `observation_count_fan_only` | `"fan_only"` |
| `ventilated_decay` | 2-param OLS attempted first (when `sf_range >= 0.30`); if fails, 1-param fallback | `k_vent_window`, `observation_count_vent`; `k_solar` additionally when `two_param=True` | `"ventilated"` |
| `solar_gain` | Mean rate: `(T_last − T_first) / total_hours`; reject if rate < 0 | `k_solar`, `observation_count_solar` | `"solar"` |
| `hvac_heat` | 2-param path: `compute_k_passive(post_samples, pre_samples)` → `compute_k_active(active_samples, k_p)`; bridge proxy and single-point fallback applied when OLS returns None | `k_active_heat`, `k_passive` (when not from proxy), `observation_count_heat`, `swing_heat_f` | `"heat"` |
| `hvac_cool` | Same as hvac_heat; `session_mode = "cool"` | `k_active_cool`, `k_passive` (when not from proxy), `observation_count_cool`, `swing_cool_f` | `"cool"` |

**Bridge proxy (hvac_heat/hvac_cool only, D17):** If `compute_k_passive()` returns `None` and `k_vent_window < 0` exists in `thermal_model_cache`, `k_vent_window` is used as proxy `k_passive` with `force_grade = "low"`. The committed obs dict writes `k_passive = None` (D21) so the proxy value never contaminates the envelope EWMA.

**Single-point fallback (D19):** If `k_active` is `None` after `compute_k_active()` (n_active < 2) and `k_p` is available (real or proxy), `compute_k_active_single_point()` is called with `T_start`, `T_peak`, `session_minutes / 60`, `k_p`, and `avg(T_in − T_out)`. Forces `grade = "low"`.

---

## EWMA Update (_update_thermal_model_cache)

Called by `record_thermal_observation()` on every successful commit. Applies one observation to the in-memory `thermal_model_cache` dict.

**Alpha lookup by confidence grade:**

| Grade | Alpha |
|---|---|
| `"high"` | 0.30 |
| `"medium"` | 0.15 |
| `"low"` | 0.05 |
| (unknown) | 0.05 |

**Confidence grade thresholds — `confidence_k_passive`** (counts from `observation_count_passive` + `observation_count_heat` + `observation_count_cool`):

| Observation count | Grade |
|---|---|
| < 5 | `"none"` |
| 5 – 14 | `"low"` |
| 15 – 29 | `"medium"` |
| ≥ 30 | `"high"` |

**Confidence grade thresholds — `confidence` (HVAC)** (counts from `observation_count_heat` + `observation_count_cool`):

| Observation count | Grade |
|---|---|
| < 5 | `"none"` |
| 5 – 9 | `"low"` |
| 10 – 19 | `"medium"` |
| ≥ 20 | `"high"` |

**EWMA formula for all continuous parameters:**
```
new_value = (1 − alpha) × old_value + alpha × observed_value
```
First observation initialises the cache field directly (no EWMA).

**Parameter routing by `obs["hvac_mode"]` (the tag written at commit time):**

| `hvac_mode` tag | Updates | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| `"heat"` | `k_passive` (EWMA if `k_p` not None), `avg_r_squared_passive`, `k_active_heat` (EWMA if `k_a` not None), `observation_count_heat`, `swing_heat_f` (if `swing_f` present) | `_envelope_modes = True` — k_passive EWMA runs |
| `"cool"` | `k_passive`, `avg_r_squared_passive`, `k_active_cool`, `observation_count_cool`, `swing_cool_f` | `_envelope_modes = True` |
| `"passive"` | `k_passive`, `avg_r_squared_passive`, `observation_count_passive` | `_envelope_modes = True` |
| `"fan_only"` | `k_vent` (EWMA of `obs["k_passive"]`), `observation_count_fan_only` | `_envelope_modes = False` — k_passive EWMA does NOT run |
| `"ventilated"` | `k_vent_window` (EWMA of `obs["k_passive"]`), `k_solar` (EWMA of `obs["k_solar"]` when `two_param=True`), `observation_count_vent` | `_envelope_modes = False` |
| `"solar"` | `k_solar` (EWMA of `obs["k_solar"]`), `observation_count_solar` | `_envelope_modes = False` |

**Swing update:** Applied for `"heat"` and `"cool"` modes only. Both `swing_heat_f` / `swing_cool_f` and their counters (`observation_count_swing_heat` / `observation_count_swing_cool`) are updated with the same alpha as the primary parameters.

## Rolling Window Constraints

| Constant | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `THERMAL_ROLLING_MIN_WINDOW_MINUTES` | 30 min | No commit attempt before this elapsed time; observation keeps accumulating regardless of signal |
| `THERMAL_ROLLING_MAX_WINDOW_MINUTES` | 240 min (4h) | Hard cap: forces commit if `len(samples) >= 5`, else abandons unconditionally; `skip_delta_guard=True` |
| `THERMAL_ROLLING_MIN_DELTA_T_F` | 0.2°F | Minimum indoor temperature range required to commit at min-window point (passive_decay, solar_gain); skipped for fan_only_decay and ventilated_decay (`skip_delta_guard=True`) |
| `THERMAL_MIN_DECAY_SAMPLES` | 4 | OLS pair floor for rolling-window commits; `_commit_rolling_window_obs` requires `len(samples) >= 5` (= 4 + 1) to guarantee 4 pairs |

**Early commit condition:** `elapsed >= THERMAL_ROLLING_MIN_WINDOW_MINUTES` AND `signal_sufficient=True`. Signal is type-specific:
- `passive_decay`: `max(indoor_temps) − min(indoor_temps) >= THERMAL_ROLLING_MIN_DELTA_T_F`
- `fan_only_decay`: same range check, but `skip_delta_guard=True` so this check is bypassed in `_commit_rolling_window_obs`
- `ventilated_decay`: indoor range check, additionally suppressed when solar keep-alive guard applies (daytime AND `sf_range < 0.30`)
- `solar_gain`: indoor range check

**Solar keep-alive guard:** Active during hours 08:00–17:59 when `sf_range < THERMAL_SOLAR_FACTOR_MIN_RANGE (0.30)`. Forces `_vent_signal_sufficient = False` for `ventilated_decay`, deferring early commit until `sf_range` meets threshold or the 240-min hard cap fires.

---

## Gate Bridge

**Activation condition (in `_build_predicted_indoor_future`):**
```python
if (_k_passive is None or _conf_k_passive == "none") and _k_vent_window is not None and _k_vent_window <= 0:
    _k_passive = _k_vent_window
    _k_passive_via_bridge = True
```

The bridge also fires when `_k_passive is not None` but `_conf_k_passive == "none"` (Bug A fix from Issue #126): the passive estimate exists but confidence is too low without the bridge.

**Proxy semantics:** `k_vent_window` is an overestimate of `k_passive` because it includes ventilation effect. Force grade `"low"` is used for any HVAC observation that uses the proxy. In `_commit_event_from_dict`, committed obs writes `k_passive=None` (D21) so the proxy never enters the envelope EWMA.

**`physics_eligible` flag (exact code, coordinator.py ~L4371):**
```python
_physics_eligible = (
    (
        _conf != "none"
        or (_conf_k_passive is not None and _conf_k_passive not in (None, "none"))
        or _k_passive_via_bridge  # bridge-provided k needs no confidence count
    )
    and _k_passive is not None
    and (_k_passive < 0 or _k_passive_via_bridge)
)
```

When `_k_passive_via_bridge=True`, the confidence count requirement is bypassed — physics activates even with `conf="none"` and `conf_k_passive="none"`.

**ODE path when bridge is active:** `_k_passive_via_bridge=True` sets a secondary guard (`_bridge_guard_applies`) that disables per-hour `k_vent_window` substitution on window-open hours when a window schedule exists. This prevents double-application: the bridge already uses `k_vent_window` as the base; substituting it again for open-window hours would overcorrect.

**Bridge guard condition:**
```python
_bridge_guard_applies = (
    _k_passive_via_bridge
    and _windows_recommended          # classification has a window schedule
    and not _hour_windows_open        # current hour is outside the open window
)
```
When the guard applies, ramp interpolation is used for that hour. When windows are NOT recommended (no schedule), the bridge runs for all hours without guard interference.

---

## Swing Detection

**Formula:** `swing_f = abs(T_end − T_start) / 2`

**T_start:** `event["start_indoor_f"]` — indoor temperature at HVAC-on event.

**T_end definitions by mode:**
- `hvac_heat`: `active_samples[-1]["indoor_temp_f"]` — temperature at HVAC shutoff (last active sample), NOT the global peak. Using the global peak would include post-heat overshoot and bias swing high.
- `hvac_cool`: `min(s["indoor_temp_f"] for s in active_samples)` — trough temperature during active cooling.

**Minimum signal gate:** `abs(T_end − T_start) >= THERMAL_HVAC_MIN_SIGNAL_F (0.5°F)`. If the delta is below this threshold, no swing value is written.

**Valid range:** `[THERMAL_SWING_MIN_F (0.1°F), THERMAL_SWING_MAX_F (5.0°F)]`. Values outside this range are discarded.

**Storage:** `swing_heat_f` and `swing_cool_f` fields in `thermal_model_cache`. Both are EWMA-accumulated independently using the same alpha as k_active for that observation.

**Default for display:** `THERMAL_SWING_DEFAULT_F = 1.5°F` — used when the observed value is None (`swing_heat_f_display` / `swing_cool_f_display` in `get_thermal_model()` output).

**Confidence tiers:**

| `observation_count_swing_heat` or `_cool` | Grade |
|---|---|
| 0 (`< THERMAL_SWING_CONF_LOW = 1`) | `"none"` |
| 1–2 (`< THERMAL_SWING_CONF_MEDIUM = 3`) | `"low"` |
| 3–9 (`< THERMAL_SWING_CONF_HIGH = 10`) | `"medium"` |
| 10+ | `"high"` |

## Dual Estimator Framework

*Added in v0.3.45 (Issue #146). Applies to both `_run_passive_chart_log_fit` and `_run_ventilated_chart_log_fit`.*

### Motivation

The in-memory consecutive-pair OLS on 5-min thermostat samples structurally fails for 1°F thermostat resolution: overnight drift of ≈0.25°F/hr produces 0.021°F per 5-min interval, well below the 1°F quantization floor. Nearly all pairs show rate=0; rare pairs show ±12°F/hr spikes. R² ≈ 0.02; almost all windows are rejected. The v0.3.43 chart_log endpoint backfill committed 8 windows at α=0.05, yielding only 33% convergence ((0.95)^8 = 0.663 weight on prior). Both k_passive and k_vent_window were ≈3–5× too large, causing the overnight predicted indoor temperature to dip 8–10°F below actual.

The dual-estimator framework runs both estimators on every overnight chart_log window and selects per-night based on data quality. Backfill v2 reprocesses 30 days, accumulating enough EWMA iterations for convergence.

### Estimator A — Endpoint

`k = ln((T_end − T_out_avg) / (T_start − T_out_avg)) / Δt_hours`

- Uses only the bookend readings of the window; immune to mid-window sensor blips that corrupt interior samples
- Natural regime filter: ratio in (0, 1) rejects solar and HVAC contamination before OLS runs
- No R² (returns `r_squared=None`); grade always `"low"`
- Source label: `"endpoint"`

### Estimator B — Block-Averaged OLS

`compute_k_passive_blocks()` on the window's chart_log entries (see [§OLS Functions — compute\_k\_passive\_blocks](#compute_k_passive_blocks)).

- 60-min blocks, minimum 6 blocks (≥6h window)
- Produces a meaningful R² (typically 0.5–0.8 on clean overnight windows)
- Source label: `"block_ols"`

### Solar Guard

Both extractors (`_extract_passive_windows`, `_extract_ventilated_windows`) accept only windows where both the start **and** end timestamps fall within local hours 20:00–08:00 (i.e., neither end is in the 08:00–19:59 daytime band). `_is_solar_hour(ts_str)` returns `True` when local hour is 8–19. Any window touching a solar hour is dropped.

This prevents solar-heated afternoon samples from contaminating the passive decay estimate for both estimators simultaneously.

### Per-Night Selection (`_select_estimator`)

`_select_estimator(result_a, result_b) -> dict | None`

Both A and B always run. The decision table selects one result and sets the final `grade`:

| A-valid | B-valid | R²_B | Agree (≤30% rel diff)? | Selection | Grade |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| no | no | — | — | `None` | — |
| yes | no | — | — | A | `low` |
| no | yes | < 0.20 | — | `None` | — |
| no | yes | 0.20–0.49 | — | B | `low` |
| no | yes | ≥ 0.50 | — | B | `medium` |
| yes | yes | < 0.20 | — | A | `low` |
| yes | yes | 0.20–0.49 | yes | B | `low` |
| yes | yes | 0.20–0.49 | no | A | `low` |
| yes | yes | ≥ 0.50 | yes | B | `medium` |
| yes | yes | ≥ 0.50 | no | A | `low` |

Agreement is defined as `abs(k_A − k_B) / max(abs(k_A), abs(k_B)) <= THERMAL_DUAL_AGREE_REL (0.30)`.

Thresholds: `THERMAL_DUAL_OLS_GOOD = 0.50` (medium grade boundary), `THERMAL_DUAL_OLS_OK = 0.20` (B-valid floor).

When both estimators are valid, `_select_estimator` logs an INFO line:
```
chart_log dual_estimator passive: k_A=−0.021 k_B=−0.019 R²_B=0.63 agree=True source=block_ols grade=medium
```

`observation_count_passive` increments by 1 per committed window regardless of which estimator won.

### Backfill v2

New flags `_passive_k_backfill_v2` and `_vent_k_backfill_v2` (distinct from the v1 `_passive_k_backfill` flag). Persisted in `_build_state_dict`, restored in `async_restore_state`.

On startup, if `_passive_k_backfill_v2` is `False`, `_run_passive_chart_log_fit(backfill=True)` processes the last 30 days of chart_log entries through the full dual-estimator pipeline. Each selected window commits one EWMA update. At medium grade (α=0.15), 30 updates converge to ≈99% of the true value: `1 − (0.85)^30 ≈ 0.990`. Same for `_vent_k_backfill_v2` via `_run_ventilated_chart_log_fit(backfill=True)`.

### Symmetric Application

`_run_ventilated_chart_log_fit` follows the same structure: extract windows with solar guard → per-window run A + B + `_select_estimator` → `record_thermal_observation`. The ventilated path writes to `k_vent_window` rather than `k_passive`, but the estimator machinery (`compute_k_passive_blocks`, `_passive_endpoint_estimate`, `_select_estimator`) is reused unchanged.

---

## Solar Factor

**Scope:** `_solar_factor(local_hour, phase_offset_h)` in `coordinator.py`. Determines how much solar gain to add to the ODE at a given local hour. Used by `_simulate_indoor_physics_v3`, `_build_predicted_indoor_future`, ventilated-decay sample injection, and the `solar_gain` observation trigger.

### Signature

```python
def _solar_factor(
    local_hour,                                              # int | float; local clock hour
    phase_offset_h=THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_OFFSET_H_DEFAULT,   # default = 2 (peak at 3pm)
) -> float
```

**Pre-conditions:**
- `local_hour` must be an `int` or `float`; any other type returns `0.0`
- `phase_offset_h` is read from `get_thermal_model()["solar_phase_offset_h"]` at each call site, falling back to `THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_OFFSET_H_DEFAULT = 2` when the learned value is not yet available

### Algorithm

```python
effective_hour = int(local_hour) - int(round(phase_offset_h))
if effective_hour < THERMAL_SOLAR_DAYTIME_START_H:   # 8
    return 0.0
if effective_hour >= THERMAL_SOLAR_DAYTIME_END_H:    # 18
    return 0.0
# sin curve over [8, 18), peak at effective_hour = 13
angle = (effective_hour - THERMAL_SOLAR_DAYTIME_START_H) / (THERMAL_SOLAR_DAYTIME_END_H - THERMAL_SOLAR_DAYTIME_START_H) * π
return max(0.0, sin(angle))
```

`effective_hour = 13` → `sin(π/2) = 1.0` (global maximum).

### Peak Mapping by Offset

| `phase_offset_h` | `effective_hour` at `local_hour = 13 + offset` | Solar factor | Real-world peak |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 13 | 1.0 | 1:00 PM (old hard-coded behavior) |
| 1 | 13 | 1.0 | 2:00 PM |
| 2 | 13 | 1.0 | 3:00 PM (default prior — `THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_OFFSET_H_DEFAULT`) |
| 3 | 13 | 1.0 | 4:00 PM |
| 4 | 13 | 1.0 | 5:00 PM |

### Algebraic Correctness

The formula satisfies `_solar_factor(13 + n, n) == 1.0` for all integer `n` in [0, 4]:

```
effective_hour = int(13 + n) - int(round(n)) = 13
sin(angle at effective_hour=13) = sin(π/2) = 1.0
```

This is the scientific proof for test `test_peak_at_15_with_offset_two` (and all offset variants).

### Call-site update pattern

All existing `_solar_factor(hour)` calls must be updated to pass `phase_offset_h`. The coordinator reads the offset once per prediction cycle:

```python
_phase_offset = self._solar_phase_offset  # float; updated each _async_update_data
# … per-hour loop:
sf = _solar_factor(h, _phase_offset)
```

`self._solar_phase_offset` is an instance attribute initialised to `THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_OFFSET_H_DEFAULT` and refreshed from `get_thermal_model()["solar_phase_offset_h"]` on each coordinator update cycle.

### Invariants

- Return value is always in [0.0, 1.0]
- Returns `0.0` when `local_hour` is not a numeric type (guards against `MagicMock` test stubs)
- Returns `0.0` for `effective_hour < 8` or `effective_hour >= 18` regardless of offset

## Solar Phase Offset Learning

**Scope:** `_estimate_solar_phase_offset`, `_run_solar_phase_chart_log_fit`, and `update_solar_phase_offset` in `coordinator.py` / `learning.py`. Learns the home's thermal lag from chart_log daytime passive windows. Writes `solar_phase_offset_h` to `thermal_model_cache` via EWMA.

### Core Concept

Buildings with high thermal mass absorb solar radiation through the afternoon and re-radiate it as heat into the interior, causing the indoor temperature peak to lag the solar peak by 2–4 hours. This lag is home-specific and must be learned, not hard-coded. The phase offset calibrates `_solar_factor` to match the home's actual thermal inertia.

### Phase Observation Formula

```
phase_obs = actual_indoor_peak_hour - 13
```

`actual_indoor_peak_hour` is the local hour of the maximum indoor temperature in the chart_log window. The value 13 is the no-offset solar peak hour. A `phase_obs` of 2 means the indoor peak occurred at 3pm — exactly 2 hours after the no-offset solar peak.

### EWMA Update Formula

```python
new_value = (1 - THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_ALPHA) × solar_phase_offset_h
           + THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_ALPHA × clamp(phase_obs, THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_OFFSET_MIN, THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_OFFSET_MAX)
```

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_ALPHA` | 0.10 | Slow EWMA — building physics changes only with major renovation |
| `THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_OFFSET_H_DEFAULT` | 2 | Prior before any learning (peak at 3pm) |
| `THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_OFFSET_MIN` | 0 | Lower clamp bound (no advance of solar peak) |
| `THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_OFFSET_MAX` | 4 | Upper clamp bound (peak at 5pm maximum) |

**First observation:** Initialises `solar_phase_offset_h` directly to the clamped `phase_obs` — no EWMA blend on the first update (same pattern as all other thermal parameters).

### Valid Window Criteria

A chart_log window is eligible for a phase observation only when all six conditions are met:

1. **HVAC off throughout:** `hvac` field is not `"heating"` or `"cooling"` for every entry
2. **Fan off throughout:** `fan` field is falsy for every entry
3. **Windows closed throughout:** `windows_open` field is `False` for every entry
4. **Daytime span:** all entries fall within local hours 08:00–20:00
5. **Minimum window span:** `last_entry_ts − first_entry_ts >= THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_MIN_WINDOW_H (4h)`
6. **Minimum entry count:** `len(window_entries) >= THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_MIN_ENTRIES (3)`
7. **Sufficient solar signal:** `max(indoor) − min(indoor) >= THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_MIN_DT_F (1.5°F)` — distinguishes a real solar rise from sensor noise
8. **Not a leading peak:** the maximum indoor temperature must NOT be the first entry — a first-entry peak means the window captured the tail of a prior peak, not a rise. A last-entry peak is acceptable (the window end may have truncated a still-rising temperature)

### Rejection Codes

| Code | Condition | Constant |
|---|---|---|
| `REJECT_TOO_FEW_SAMPLES` | `len(window_entries) < THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_MIN_ENTRIES` | Existing constant |
| `REJECT_WINDOW_TOO_SHORT` | Window span < `THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_MIN_WINDOW_H` | New in v0.3.46 |
| `REJECT_SMALL_DELTA` | Indoor ΔT < `THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_MIN_DT_F` | Existing constant |
| `REJECT_NO_INTERIOR_PEAK` | Peak is at the first entry (`peak_idx == 0`) — a last-entry peak is accepted | New in v0.3.46 |

### New Functions

**`_estimate_solar_phase_offset(window_entries) → (float | None, str | None)`**

- **Input:** list of chart_log entry dicts (fields: `ts`, `indoor`, `outdoor`, `hvac`, `fan`, `windows_open`)
- **Pre-conditions:** all valid window criteria above
- **Computation:** find `idx = argmax(indoor values)`; reject if `idx == 0` (leading peak, not a rise); compute `phase_obs = local_hour(ts[idx]) − 13`
- **Post-conditions:** returns `(phase_obs_clamped, None)` on success; `(None, reject_code)` on any failure
- **Invariant:** exactly one of `phase_obs` or `reject_code` is non-None

**`_run_solar_phase_chart_log_fit(backfill=False)`**

- **Purpose:** iterates daytime passive windows in the chart_log and calls `_estimate_solar_phase_offset` on each, calling `self.learning.update_solar_phase_offset(phase_obs, THERMAL_SOLAR_PHASE_ALPHA)` on each accepted window. When `backfill=True`, scans the last 30 days; when `backfill=False`, scans only the last 2 days (most-recent qualifying window only via `windows[-1:]`)
- **Backfill flag:** `_solar_phase_backfill: bool` persisted in state. On startup, if `False`, runs in `backfill=True` mode over the last 30 days and sets flag to `True`
- **Call site:** called once at startup (inside the chart_log processing block in `_async_update_data`) when `_solar_phase_backfill` is `False`. No incremental per-cycle call is made after the backfill flag is set

**`learning.update_solar_phase_offset(observed_h, alpha)`**

- Applies EWMA update to `thermal_model_cache["solar_phase_offset_h"]`
- On first call (value is `None`), initialises directly: `solar_phase_offset_h = clamp(observed_h, MIN, MAX)`
- Sets `first_active_date_phase_offset` to today's ISO date string on the first call
- Thread-safe: called only from the coordinator's async context

### `_build_learning_health` update

`REJECT_WINDOW_TOO_SHORT` and `REJECT_NO_INTERIOR_PEAK` must be added to `all_reason_codes` in `_build_learning_health()` in `coordinator.py` so they appear in the rejection summary exposed to the AI investigator and dashboard.

---

## Engine Visibility

**Scope:** `get_engine_status()` in `learning.py`; `first_active_date_*` fields in `thermal_model_cache`; REST endpoint in `api.py`; dashboard card in `index.html`; AI context in `ai_skills_activity.py`; CLI tool `tools/engine_status.py`.

### Per-Parameter Activation Tracking

When `_update_thermal_model_cache` writes a parameter for the first time (transition from `None` → first real value), it also sets the corresponding `first_active_date_*` field to today's ISO date string (e.g., `"2026-04-01"`). The field is never overwritten on subsequent updates.

| Cache field | Tracks first activation of |
|---|---|
| `first_active_date_passive` | `k_passive` |
| `first_active_date_solar` | `k_solar` |
| `first_active_date_phase_offset` | `solar_phase_offset_h` |
| `first_active_date_vent_window` | `k_vent_window` |
| `first_active_date_hvac` | `k_active_heat` or `k_active_cool` (whichever is first) |

All five fields are initialised to `None` in `thermal_model_cache` and included in the learning JSON on every persist cycle.

### `get_engine_status()` Return Shape

`learning.get_engine_status() → dict`

```python
{
  "k_passive": {
    "active": bool,          # True when k_passive is not None

  "physics_eligible": bool,  # True when the ODE prediction path is currently active
  "physics_eligible_reason": str,  # human-readable explanation of eligibility state
}
```

**`physics_eligible_reason` values** (returned by `get_engine_status()`; bridge-home state is not reflected here — bridge activation is determined in `_build_predicted_indoor_future`):

| Condition | Reason string |
|---|---|
| `k_passive is None` | `"k_passive not yet learned"` |
| `k_passive >= 0` (wrong sign) | `"k_passive has wrong sign"` |
| `confidence_k_passive == "none"` | `"confidence insufficient (none)"` |
| `k_passive < 0` and `confidence != "none"` | `f"k_passive + confidence={conf_k_passive}"` (e.g. `"k_passive + confidence=low"`) |

### Exposure Points

| Consumer | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| REST API | `GET /api/climate_advisor/engines` returns `get_engine_status()` JSON directly |
| Dashboard Debug tab | "Prediction Engines" card in `index.html`; table: engine \| active \| value \| confidence \| since; auto-refreshes with status panel |
| AI investigator | `ACTIVE_PREDICTION_ENGINES` section prepended to activity context in `ai_skills_activity.py`; plain-text table for LLM consumption |
| CLI tool | `tools/engine_status.py` reads learning DB via SSH (same pattern as `tools/learning_db.py`), prints formatted table; `--history` flag also tails `ha_logs.py --thermal` and greps for engine activation events |

### `get_thermal_model()` additions

`solar_phase_offset_h` and all five `first_active_date_*` fields are included in the `get_thermal_model()` return dict. Downstream consumers (`coordinator.py`, `api.py`, `ai_skills_activity.py`) read from this output, not from `thermal_model_cache` directly.

---

## Invariants

The following conditions must always hold after a successful commit and EWMA update:

1. **k_passive sign:** Every value written to `cache["k_passive"]` via `_update_thermal_model_cache` is negative (`k_p < 0`). The `REJECT_OLS_WRONG_SIGN` check in `compute_k_passive` enforces this before any value reaches the cache. The only exception is the bridge proxy path in `_commit_event_from_dict` — but in that path `k_passive=None` is written to the obs dict (D21), so the cache is never updated with the proxy value.

2. **k_vent_window sign:** `k_vent_window` in cache is always ≤ 0 when valid. The bridge activation check (`_k_vent_window <= 0`) enforces this. A value of exactly 0.0 is physically valid (perfectly inert home with zero ventilation effect) and produces a flat ODE prediction.

3. **k_solar sign:** `k_solar` is always non-negative. The bounds check `0.0 <= k_solar <= THERMAL_K_SOLAR_MAX_F_PER_HR` in `_commit_event_from_dict` and the mean-rate sign check (`if mean_rate < 0: reject`) for solar_gain observations enforce this.

4. **Separation of envelope and ventilation:** The guard `_envelope_modes = mode not in ("fan_only", "ventilated")` in `_update_thermal_model_cache` ensures that `fan_only` and `ventilated` observations never write to `cache["k_passive"]`. Only `"heat"`, `"cool"`, and `"passive"` modes update the envelope decay estimate.

5. **Rejection code exclusivity:** `compute_k_passive` returns exactly one of `(k_passive, rejection_code)` as non-None. The function never returns both `k_passive` and a `rejection_code` as non-None simultaneously.

6. **Obs cap:** `thermal_observations` list in `LearningState` never exceeds `THERMAL_OBS_CAP (200)` entries. The 90-day rolling trim runs first; the hard cap enforces the absolute maximum.

7. **Rejection log cap:** Each obs_type bucket in `rejection_log` is capped at 100 entries. Both `_abandon_observation()` in coordinator and `load_state()` enforce this cap.

8. **Bridge does not contaminate k_passive EWMA:** When `_k_p_from_proxy=True` in `_commit_event_from_dict`, `obs["k_passive"] = None` is set before calling `record_thermal_observation()`. This ensures `_update_thermal_model_cache` sees `k_p = None` and skips the `k_passive` EWMA update.

9. **ODE k_passive must be negative for exponential decay:** `_simulate_indoor_physics` and `_simulate_indoor_physics_v3` use `exp(k_passive * dt_hours)`. With `k_passive < 0` this decays toward `t_outdoor`; with `k_passive = 0` the division-by-zero branch uses linear extrapolation (`t_start + q * dt_hours`). The bridge allows `k_vent_window = 0.0` exactly, which routes to this linear branch — correct for a perfectly inert home.
