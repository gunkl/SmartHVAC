# Climate Advisor — Daily Briefing Examples

These are example briefings for each day type, showing the tone, structure, and content the system produces. The briefing is the primary user interface — it should feel like a message from a helpful friend who manages your home climate, not a technical report.

## Structure (every briefing)

1. Structured header with today/tomorrow temps, day type, and trend (scannable at a glance)
2. Conversational body — flowing prose paragraphs covering the day plan, what the system will do, and what the user can do to help
3. "If you head out" paragraph — occupancy setback behavior
4. "Fresh air" paragraph — affirms the user's right to open a window anytime, explains what the system will do in response, describes the impact on the day's climate strategy, and suggests how to minimize that impact. Varies by HVAC mode.
5. "Looking ahead" paragraph — trend-based preview of tonight/tomorrow
6. Learning suggestions (when available after 14+ days, kept structured for accept/dismiss clarity)

## Example: Mild Day with Warming Trend

**Conditions:** Today high 68°F, low 48°F, tomorrow high 78°F

```
🏠 Your Home Climate Plan for Today
========================================

Today: High 68°F / Low 48°F
Tomorrow: High 78°F / Low 58°F
Day Type: Mild | Trend: Significantly warmer tomorrow (+10°F)

This is the good stuff — a day where the house practically takes care of itself. I ran the heater to 70°F before sunrise, and now it's off for the day. The weather does the rest.

By 10:00 AM, the outside air will be around 60°F and climbing. If you open windows on the south and east side first, you'll get a natural cross-breeze that freshens the air and warms the house for free.

Through the afternoon, no HVAC needed at all. Enjoy the break!

Close up the windows by 5:00 PM to trap the warmth before the sun drops. The house should coast comfortably through dinner. If it dips below 68°F later tonight, I'll gently kick the heater back on — but that's all automatic.

If you head out, nothing really changes today — the HVAC is off. If it was running as a safety net, it'll set back on its own.

If you want to open a window for some fresh air, go for it — the HVAC is off today so there's no energy impact at all. Enjoy the breeze. If the system does need to kick on as a safety net later and a window is still open, I'll give it a few minutes and then pause until you close up.

Looking ahead — tomorrow's warmer at 78°F, so I'm going to set back a bit more aggressively tonight. Less heating needed means energy saved while you sleep.

## Example: Warm Day

**Conditions:** Today high 80°F, low 60°F, tomorrow high 82°F

```
🏠 Your Home Climate Plan for Today
========================================

Today: High 80°F / Low 60°F
Tomorrow: High 82°F / Low 62°F
Day Type: Warm | Trend: Stable

The HVAC is off this morning — the house held its temperature nicely overnight. Around 8:00 AM, it'll be a great time to open some windows. Opening on opposite sides gives you a nice cross-breeze that keeps things comfortable without the AC.

You'll want to close things up by 6:00 PM though — I'll be ready to kick on the AC if temps push above 75°F, and it works much better with the house sealed up.

If you head out, nothing really changes today — the HVAC is off. If it was running as a safety net, it'll set back on its own.

If you want to open a window for some fresh air, go for it — the HVAC is off today so there's no energy impact at all. Enjoy the breeze. If the system does need to kick on as a safety net later and a window is still open, I'll give it a few minutes and then pause until you close up.

Tomorrow looks pretty similar to today — 82°F for a high. Nothing special planned overnight.

## Example: Hot Day

**Conditions:** Today high 95°F, low 72°F, tomorrow high 92°F

```
🏠 Your Home Climate Plan for Today
========================================

Today: High 95°F / Low 72°F
Tomorrow: High 92°F / Low 70°F
Day Type: Hot | Trend: Stable

I got a head start on the heat this morning. The AC pre-cooled the house to 73°F while the outdoor air was still cool — that banking strategy saves a lot of energy over the course of the day.

Today's a keep-it-sealed kind of day. Keep all windows and doors closed, and if you can, close the blinds on sun-facing windows (especially west-facing ones after noon). I'll hold things at 75°F all day — you shouldn't need to touch anything.

If outdoor temps drop below 75°F after sunset, I'll send you a heads-up that it's safe to open windows and give the AC a rest. If you do open up, I'll handle shutting the AC off automatically.

If you head out, no worries. After about 15 minutes I'll let the house drift up to 80°F to save energy. When you're back, I'll pull it right back down — give it 20 to 30 minutes to feel normal again.

If you want to crack a window for some fresh air, no problem — it's your house. I'll keep the AC running for a few minutes in case it's just a quick thing, but if it stays open past 3 minutes I'll shut the AC off so you're not cooling the outdoors. Once you close up, I'll fire the AC back up right away. Just know that on a day like today it may take a bit longer to pull back down to 75°F, so if you want to minimize the impact, shorter is better — and try to keep other windows and doors shut while you've got one open.

Tomorrow looks pretty similar to today — 92°F for a high. Nothing special planned overnight.

## Example: Cool Day with Cooling Trend

**Conditions:** Today high 55°F, low 35°F, tomorrow high 50°F

```
🏠 Your Home Climate Plan for Today
========================================

Today: High 55°F / Low 35°F
Tomorrow: High 50°F / Low 30°F
Day Type: Cool | Trend: Cooling trend (-5°F)

It's a heater day. I'll keep the house at 70°F through the morning — it's too cool outside for windows today, so we're staying sealed up.

Between about 11am and 3pm, I'll ease the setpoint back a couple degrees to ride whatever solar gain the house picks up through the windows. You won't notice the difference, but it saves a bit of energy.

After 3pm I'll bring it back to 70°F as the sun drops. At bedtime, I'll set things to 66°F for sleeping — most people sleep better a little cooler.

If you head out, I'll drop to 60°F after about 15 minutes. When you get back, I'll warm things right up — should take 20 to 30 minutes depending on how long you were gone.

If you want to open a window for some fresh air, no problem — go for it. I'll keep the heat running for a few minutes in case you're just airing things out, but if it stays open past 3 minutes I'll turn the heat off so we're not heating the neighborhood. Once you close up, the heat kicks right back on. It'll take a little extra energy to warm back up, so if you want to minimize the impact, a quick burst of fresh air works great — and closing doors to the room with the open window helps keep the rest of the house comfortable while you do it.

Looking ahead — tomorrow's cooler at 50°F, so I'll bank some extra warmth this evening and go easy on the overnight setback. If the house feels a touch warmer than usual before bed, that's intentional.

## Example: Cold Day with Cooling Trend

**Conditions:** Today high 38°F, low 22°F, tomorrow high 28°F

```
🏠 Your Home Climate Plan for Today
========================================

Today: High 38°F / Low 22°F
Tomorrow: High 28°F / Low 12°F
Day Type: Cold | Trend: Significant cold front coming (-10°F)

It's going to be cold out there. The heater runs all day at 70°F, and you can help it out — keep doors and windows closed, minimize how long you hold exterior doors open, and close curtains on the north side. If you have south-facing windows, open those curtains to grab some free solar heat.

Tomorrow's even colder, so I'm going to bank some extra heat this evening. Starting around 7pm, I'll bump the setpoint up to 73°F for a couple hours, then coast into the night. The house will feel extra warm before bed — that's on purpose.

Tonight I'm using a conservative setback — 67°F instead of the usual 60°F. When it's this cold, a deeper setback takes too long to recover from in the morning.

If you head out, I'll drop to 60°F after about 15 minutes. When you get back, I'll warm things right up — should take 20 to 30 minutes depending on how long you were gone.

If you want to open a window for some fresh air, no problem — go for it. I'll keep the heat running for a few minutes in case you're just airing things out, but if it stays open past 3 minutes I'll turn the heat off so we're not heating the neighborhood. Once you close up, the heat kicks right back on. It'll take a little extra energy to warm back up, so if you want to minimize the impact, a quick burst of fresh air works great — and closing doors to the room with the open window helps keep the rest of the house comfortable while you do it.

Looking ahead — tomorrow's cooler at 28°F, so I'll bank some extra warmth this evening and go easy on the overnight setback. If the house feels a touch warmer than usual before bed, that's intentional.

## Example: Learning Suggestion Appended to Briefing

After 14+ days, a briefing might end with:

```
💡 Suggestions Based on Recent Patterns
----------------------------------------
  • Over the past 18 days where opening windows was recommended,
    they were opened only 22% of the time. Would you like Climate
    Advisor to stop suggesting window actions and instead rely on
    HVAC with optimized schedules? This uses slightly more energy
    but requires no manual action.

  • You've manually adjusted the thermostat 14 times in the past
    two weeks. This may indicate the comfort setpoints don't match
    your preferences. Would you like Climate Advisor to analyze
    the override patterns and suggest new setpoints?

Reply ACCEPT or DISMISS to any suggestion, or ignore to keep current behavior.
```

## Voice Rules

- First person from the system: "I'll turn on the AC", not "the system will"
- Always "you" for the user, never "the homeowner"
- User-centric framing: affirm the user's choices first ("no problem — it's your house"), then explain what the system does in response
- Cause-and-effect: explain *why* before asking the user to do something ("close windows by noon so the AC can work efficiently")
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Numerals for all temps and times (not spelled out)
- No emoji in the conversational body (emoji only in the structured header and learning suggestions)
- Key times and temperatures should appear in prominent sentence positions where they naturally draw the eye
- Scannable in 30 seconds — someone should be able to glance and know what they need to do today
