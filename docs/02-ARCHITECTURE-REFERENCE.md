## Key Data Structures

### ForecastSnapshot (classifier.py)
Contains today_high, today_low, tomorrow_high, tomorrow_low, current_outdoor_temp, current_indoor_temp, current_humidity, timestamp.

### DayClassification (classifier.py)
Produced by `classify_day()`. Contains day_type, trend_direction, trend_magnitude, and computed recommendations: hvac_mode, pre_condition, windows_recommended, window_open/close times, setback_modifier.

### DailyRecord (learning.py)
One day's tracked data: what was recommended, what actually happened, outcomes (runtime, overrides, comfort violations). Stored as JSON, rolling 90-day window.

### Debounce and Grace Period System

**Debounce** (`sensor_debounce_seconds`): A door or window must remain open for this duration before HVAC is paused. Quick pass-throughs that close within the window have no effect. Default: 5 minutes.

**Manual grace period** (`manual_grace_seconds`): After the user manually turns HVAC back on during a door/window pause, Climate Advisor stays hands-off for this duration. Door/window sensors cannot trigger another pause during this window — the user just overrode the system and should not be immediately overridden back. Default: 30 minutes. Notification on expiry: off by default.

**Automation grace period** (`automation_grace_seconds`): After Climate Advisor itself resumes HVAC (all doors/windows closed), it waits this duration before door/window sensors can trigger another pause. This prevents rapid cycling when someone is moving in and out. Default: 60 minutes. Notification on expiry: on by default so the user knows normal sensing has resumed.

Setting either grace period to 0 disables it entirely.

**Timer priority**: Manual override always takes highest priority. When a user manually turns HVAC on during a door/window pause:
1. The pause is immediately lifted (`paused_by_door` → False)
2. All pending debounce timers for still-open sensors are cancelled
3. A manual grace period starts, blocking any new pause events for its configured duration
4. After the grace period expires, normal door/window sensing resumes

This ensures the user's explicit action is never overridden by a stale or pending debounce timer.

```
Sequence: sensor opens → debounce timer → HVAC paused → user turns on
           → manual grace starts (all debounce timers cancelled)
           → grace expires → normal sensing resumes
```

**Briefing integration**: The daily briefing automatically mentions active grace periods so users understand why door/window sensing may behave differently than expected. The fresh air section also shows the actual configured debounce duration (e.g., "5 minutes" instead of a hardcoded value) so the briefing always reflects the user's settings.

## Observe-Only Mode (Disable Automation)

Climate Advisor exposes a `switch.climate_advisor_automation` entity that controls whether real actions are executed.

**When ON (default)**: Normal operation — all thermostat changes and notifications are executed.

**When OFF (observe-only)**: The full computation pipeline continues (classification, decision-making, state tracking, logging) but all HA service calls are skipped:

- `climate.set_hvac_mode` — skipped
- `climate.set_temperature` — skipped
- `notify.*` — skipped (including daily briefing delivery)

Skipped actions are logged at INFO level with a `[DRY RUN]` prefix:
```
INFO  [DRY RUN] Would set HVAC mode to cool — daily classification — hot day, trend warming 8°F
INFO  [DRY RUN] Would set temperature to 72°F — bedtime — heat setback (comfort 70 - 4 + modifier 2)
INFO  [DRY RUN] Would send notification: Climate Advisor — 🏠 Welcome home! ...
```

### Implementation

Guards are placed at the 3 thermostat primitives (`_set_hvac_mode`, `_set_temperature`, `_notify`) in `AutomationEngine` plus the briefing notification in the coordinator. Higher-level logic (classification application, door/window pause tracking, grace periods, occupancy handling) continues unaffected.

The toggle state is persisted via `StatePersistence` and survives HA restarts. It is also exposed in the dashboard API (`/api/climate_advisor/status`) and debug state.
