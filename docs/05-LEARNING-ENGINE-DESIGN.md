# Climate Advisor — Learning Engine Design

## Purpose

The learning engine is what makes Climate Advisor more than a fancy scheduler. It observes the gap between what was recommended and what actually happened, and uses that gap to suggest improvements. The long-term goal is a system that adapts to the household's real behavior rather than insisting on idealized behavior.

## Core Principle

**If you give people a behavior to perform and they rarely do it, calculate a better alternative that can be performed and ask the user if they'd like to switch.**

## Data Collection

Every day, a `DailyRecord` is saved with:

### What Was Recommended
- Day type and trend
- Whether windows were recommended (and suggested open/close times)
- Recommended HVAC mode

### What Actually Happened
- Whether windows were opened (and actual times)
- Total HVAC runtime in minutes
- Time spent away from home
- Number of door/window pause events
- Number of manual thermostat overrides

### Outcomes
- Average indoor temperature
- Minutes spent outside comfort range (comfort violations)
- Estimated energy cost (future: from utility rate integration)

### Suggestion Tracking
- Was a suggestion sent today?
- User response: accepted, dismissed, or ignored

## Storage

- JSON file in HA config directory (`climate_advisor_learning.json`)
- Rolling 90-day window (older records pruned automatically)
- Persists across HA restarts

## Suggestion Generation

Suggestions are generated when `generate_suggestions()` is called (typically during the daily briefing). Requires minimum 14 days of data.

### Pattern: Low Window Compliance

**Detection:** Of days where windows were recommended, compliance < 30%.
**Suggestion:** "Would you like Climate Advisor to stop suggesting window actions and instead rely on HVAC with optimized schedules?"
**If accepted:** `disable_window_recommendations = True` — the briefing stops suggesting window actions, and the automation engine uses HVAC for those day types instead.
**Trade-off:** Slightly higher energy use, zero human effort required.

### Pattern: Frequent Manual Overrides

**Detection:** More than 10 manual thermostat adjustments in 14 days.
**Suggestion:** "Would you like Climate Advisor to analyze the override patterns and suggest new setpoints?"
**If accepted:** System flags for setpoint analysis (future: actually analyze the override direction and magnitude to suggest specific new setpoints).
**Trade-off:** May result in slightly different comfort baseline.

### Pattern: High Runtime on Mild/Warm Days

**Detection:** Average HVAC runtime > 120 minutes on mild/warm day types.
**Suggestion:** "Would you like to add more door/window sensors, or adjust the setpoints for mild days?"
**Root cause:** Usually indicates doors/windows being left open without sensors, or setpoints that are too aggressive for the house's thermal characteristics.

### Pattern: Short Departures

**Detection:** More than 5 departures of 30–45 minutes in 14 days.
**Suggestion:** "Would you like to shorten the setback delay from 15 minutes to 5 minutes, or skip setback for departures under 1 hour?"
**Insight:** The current 15-minute delay means the setback barely takes effect before the person returns, wasting the recovery energy. Options: faster setback (saves more) or skip setback (saves the recovery penalty).

### Pattern: Comfort Violations

**Detection:** Indoor temp outside comfort range for > 30 minutes on 5+ of the last 14 days.
**Suggestion:** "Would you like to reduce the setback aggressiveness, or start the morning warm-up earlier?"
**If accepted:** Setback modifier increases by 2°F (less aggressive), and/or morning pre-heat starts 15 minutes earlier.

### Pattern: Frequent Door Pauses

**Detection:** More than 20 HVAC pause events from door/window sensors in 14 days.
**Suggestion:** "If a specific door is the main culprit, would you like to extend the pause delay for that door, or exclude it from monitoring?"
**Future enhancement:** Track which specific sensor triggers most pauses and name it in the suggestion.

## Suggestion Lifecycle

1. **Generated:** During daily briefing generation, based on pattern analysis
2. **Delivered:** Appended to the daily briefing email/notification
3. **Response:** User can accept, dismiss, or ignore
   - **Accept:** Config changes are applied, recorded in settings_history
   - **Dismiss:** Suggestion key added to dismissed list, won't reappear for SUGGESTION_COOLDOWN_DAYS (7)
   - **Ignore:** Suggestion reappears next day until acted on or pattern resolves

## Thermal Model

The thermal model characterises how the house envelope and HVAC system move indoor temperature over time. Observations accumulate continuously from six parallel sources — passive temperature drift, fan operation, window ventilation, solar gain, and HVAC heating/cooling cycles — and are used to compute adaptive bedtime setback depth, pre-heat start time, and the physics-based predicted temperature curve shown in the dashboard.

### Physics Model (Issue #114 v2 / Issue #121 v3)

The v3 ODE adds ventilation and solar terms to the v2 two-parameter model:

```
dT/dt = (k_passive + k_vent_eff) * (T_out - T_in) + k_solar * solar_factor + Q_hvac
```

where:
- `k_passive` (hr⁻¹, always negative) — envelope decay rate; how fast the house drifts toward outdoor temperature with no HVAC, no fan, and no solar gain
- `k_vent` (hr⁻¹, negative) — additional decay rate from HVAC fan circulation only
- `k_vent_window` (hr⁻¹, negative) — additional decay rate when windows are open
- `k_solar` (°F/hr per unit solar factor) — solar gain contribution
- `k_vent_eff` = `k_vent` when fan is active, `k_vent_window` when windows are open, 0 otherwise
- `solar_factor` = sinusoidal 0 → 1 → 0 over daylight hours (local 8:00–18:00)
- `Q_hvac` = `k_active_heat` when heating, `k_active_cool` when cooling, 0 otherwise

**Analytical ODE solution** used for prediction and simulation:

```
T(t+dt) = T_outdoor + (T - T_outdoor) * exp(k_p * dt) + (Q/k_p) * (exp(k_p * dt) - 1)
```

**Why OLS regression over single-point delta:** The original scalar model computed `end_temp – start_temp` at the moment HVAC stopped. Thermostat sensor lag (15–30 s) means those two temperatures are often equal, yielding `rate = 0°F/hr` and causing the observation to be dropped. The OLS architecture builds the model from the full post-heat decay curve and the active-phase samples together, eliminating the lag problem.

### v3 Parallel Observation Architecture (Issue #121)

The v2 architecture had a single `PendingThermalEvent` state machine — only one observation could accumulate at a time. v3 replaces this with a `_pending_observations: dict[str, PendingObservation]` dict keyed by observation type string. All six types can run concurrently; each type targets a different thermal parameter.

#### Observation Types

| Type | Trigger conditions | Target parameter | Min samples |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hvac_heat` | `hvac_action = "heating"` | `k_active_heat`, `k_passive` (via pre-heat buffer) | 10 post-heat |
| `hvac_cool` | `hvac_action = "cooling"` | `k_active_cool` | 10 post-heat |
| `passive_decay` | HVAC off, fan off, windows closed, `\|ΔT\|` ≥ 3°F (indoor vs outdoor) | `k_passive` | 30 |
| `fan_only_decay` | Fan active (`_fan_active` or thermostat `fan_only` mode), HVAC off, windows closed | `k_vent` | 15 |
| `ventilated_decay` | Any window/door sensor open, HVAC off | `k_vent_window` | 20 |
| `solar_gain` | HVAC off, fan off, windows closed, `T_in > T_out`, daytime (local 8:00–18:00) | `k_solar` | 20 |

**HVAC contamination rule:** When HVAC starts, all four non-HVAC observations in progress are committed (if sufficient samples) or abandoned. HVAC operation contaminates passive/vent/solar signals.

**HVAC plateau guard:** After the HVAC active phase ends, the observation is committed only if `peak_indoor_f − end_indoor_f ≥ THERMAL_HVAC_MIN_DECAY_F (0.3°F)`. The guard was reduced from 1.0°F in v3 — the old threshold rejected all observations on short-cycling thermostats.

#### Sampling Cadence (Issue #122 H1 — Decimation)

The coordinator polls every 30 seconds. Sampling all slow decay phenomena at poll rate yields noise — the temperature change between two adjacent samples is dominated by sensor quantisation, not the signal. Per-type sample gates enforce a minimum wall-clock interval between recorded samples:

| Type | Sample interval | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `hvac_heat` / `hvac_cool` (active phase) | Every poll (no gate) | Active HVAC is fast; all samples needed |
| `hvac_heat` / `hvac_cool` (post-heat phase) | 5 min (`THERMAL_HVAC_POST_HEAT_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S`) | Post-heat decay is passive dynamics |
| `passive_decay` | 5 min (`THERMAL_PASSIVE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S`) | Slow drift; 5-min samples give clean signal |
| `fan_only_decay` | 2 min (`THERMAL_FAN_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S`) | Fan effect faster than passive; 2-min gives adequate resolution |
| `ventilated_decay` | 5 min (`THERMAL_PASSIVE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S`) | Window-open drift is slow |
| `solar_gain` | 5 min (`THERMAL_SOLAR_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S`) | Solar ramp is slow; 5-min gives adequate resolution |

The gate is stored as `"last_sample_time"` in the observation dict. Section A of `_sample_all_observations()` checks `elapsed_since_last >= _interval_s` before appending a sample.

**Convergence improvement:** With 5-min decimation, a 6-hour passive overnight window yields ~72 samples vs. the noise-ridden 720 samples at 30-s poll rate. The 30-sample minimum (`THERMAL_PASSIVE_MIN_SAMPLES`) is calibrated to 5-min intervals, requiring ~2.5 hours of clean signal.

#### Rolling-Window Commits (Issue #122 H2)

Long observation windows are accurate but slow to accumulate. Rolling commits break each long observation into overlapping 30-minute windows. After `THERMAL_ROLLING_WINDOW_MINUTES (30 min)` elapses, the observation is committed and immediately restarted (if conditions still hold on the next poll).

Rolling commit rules (in `_commit_rolling_window_obs()`):
- Minimum 3 samples in the window (absolute floor)
- For `passive_decay` and `solar_gain`: total indoor ΔT ≥ `THERMAL_ROLLING_MIN_DELTA_T_F (0.2°F)` — prevents noise-fitting on near-flat data
- For `fan_only_decay` and `ventilated_decay`: the ΔT guard is skipped (`skip_delta_guard=True`); the signal guarantee for those types is the indoor–outdoor differential (checked by the trigger condition), not the temperature trend

**Convergence impact:** Rolling windows produce ~16 `passive_decay` commits per overnight period (6 hours ÷ 30 min) vs. 1 per full-night commit in v2. The model reaches 5% accuracy in ~4 nights (α = 0.05 EWMA) vs. ~60 nights before.

#### Wall-Clock Abandon Timeout (Issue #122 H4)

`ventilated_decay` and `fan_only_decay` have a 60-minute wall-clock abandon limit (`THERMAL_DECAY_MAX_WINDOW_MINUTES`). If 60 minutes elapse without the rolling-window commit threshold being met and without the signal crossing the minimum ΔT guard, the observation is abandoned with reason `"max_window_elapsed_low_signal"`. This prevents stale, low-signal observations from persisting indefinitely when a window is left open in near-equilibrium conditions.

`passive_decay` and `solar_gain` do not have this wall-clock timeout — they rely on rolling commits to bound window length.

### Observation Lifecycle Methods

| Method | Owner | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `_start_hvac_observation(session_mode)` | `coordinator.py` | Begins `hvac_heat` or `hvac_cool`; abandons/commits non-HVAC obs; attaches pre-heat buffer |
| `_start_decay_observation(obs_type)` | `coordinator.py` | Creates `passive_decay`, `fan_only_decay`, `ventilated_decay`, or `solar_gain` observation dict |
| `_sample_all_observations()` | `coordinator.py` | Section A: samples all active obs with per-type decimation gate. Section B: checks trigger conditions and starts new non-HVAC obs. Section C: evaluates exit conditions and calls commit/abandon per type |
| `_end_hvac_active_phase(obs_type)` | `coordinator.py` | Transitions HVAC obs `active → post_heat` when `hvac_action` leaves heating/cooling |
| `_check_hvac_stabilization(obs_type)` | `coordinator.py` | Evaluates stabilization criterion for HVAC post-heat; applies plateau guard; commits or abandons |
| `_commit_observation(obs_type)` | `coordinator.py` | Passes observation dict to `learning._commit_event_from_dict()`; pops from `_pending_observations` |
| `_commit_observation_if_sufficient(obs_type, abandon_reason)` | `coordinator.py` | Commits if `len(samples) >= min_samples` (with short-window ΔT guard), else abandons |
| `_commit_rolling_window_obs(obs_type, obs)` | `coordinator.py` | Commits a 30-min rolling window slice; pops observation so it can be restarted |
| `_abandon_observation(obs_type, reason)` | `coordinator.py` | Discards pending observation; logs WARNING with type, reason, sample count, and ΔT |
| `_update_thermal_model_cache(obs)` | `learning.py` | Applies committed observation to EWMA cache; routes each mode to the correct parameter |

**Pre-heat buffer:** `_pre_heat_sample_buffer` is sampled every coordinator poll regardless of HVAC state. Holds at most `THERMAL_PRE_HEAT_BUFFER_MINUTES (15)` entries. When `_start_hvac_observation()` fires, these samples are included in the HVAC observation's `pre_heat_samples` list and contribute to the OLS regression for `k_passive`.

### Parameter Extraction

`k_passive` is estimated from OLS regression over post-heat decay samples (plus pre-heat buffer for HVAC obs):

```
rate_i = k_passive * delta_i
```

where `rate_i = ΔT/Δt` (°F/hr) and `delta_i = T_indoor − T_outdoor` for each sample pair. Minimum: 10 post-heat samples, R² ≥ 0.2.

`k_active` is extracted from active-phase HVAC samples:

```
k_active_i = rate_i - k_passive * delta_i
```

Mean of per-sample estimates; out-of-bounds values rejected by sanity bounds.

`k_vent` (fan-only decay) and `k_vent_window` (ventilated decay) use the same OLS formula as `k_passive` on their respective sample sets.

`k_solar` is extracted from solar gain observations as a mean rate adjusted for `solar_factor`.

**Confidence grades and EWMA alpha:**

| Grade | k_passive condition | k_active condition | EWMA alpha |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"high"` | R² ≥ 0.7 and ≥ 10 post samples | R² ≥ 0.7 | 0.30 |
| `"medium"` | R² ≥ 0.4 and ≥ 5 post samples | R² ≥ 0.4 | 0.15 |
| `"low"` | R² ≥ 0.2 (minimum) | any passing sanity bounds | 0.05 |
| rejected | R² < 0.2 or < 10 post samples | — | observation discarded |

Rolling-window commits are always committed with `force_grade="low"` (α = 0.05), reflecting the shorter sample window.

### `_update_thermal_model_cache()` Routing (Issue #122 E6 fix)

Each committed observation updates the EWMA cache in `learning.py`. The routing by `hvac_mode` field:

| `hvac_mode` value | Updates | Counter incremented |
|---|---|---|
| `"heat"` | `k_active_heat` (if `k_active` present), `k_passive` (always if present) | `observation_count_heat` |
| `"cool"` | `k_active_cool` (if `k_active` present), `k_passive` (always if present) | `observation_count_cool` |
| `"passive"` | `k_passive` only (no `k_vent` update) | `observation_count_passive` |
| `"fan_only"` | `k_vent` (from `k_passive` field of the obs) | `observation_count_fan_only` |
| `"ventilated"` | `k_vent_window` (from `k_passive` field of the obs) | `observation_count_vent` |
| `"solar"` | `k_solar` (from `k_solar` field of the obs) | `observation_count_solar` |

**E6 fix (Issue #122):** The `passive` branch no longer writes `k_p` to `cache["k_vent"]`. Before this fix, `passive_decay` observations were incorrectly populating the ventilation parameter. Now only `fan_only` observations update `k_vent`.

### `record_thermal_observation(obs: dict) -> None`

Called by `learning._commit_event_from_dict()` after parameter extraction. Appends the observation to the rolling history (capped at 90 entries) and calls `_update_thermal_model_cache()`. State is saved to disk immediately after each commit — HA restarts mid-day do not lose accumulated observations.

### Predicted Indoor Temperature — Band Schedule Alignment (Issue #119)

`_build_predicted_indoor_future()` in `coordinator.py` accepts a `classification` parameter alongside `thermal_model`. When both are provided:

- The target band schedule is computed once via `_compute_target_band_schedule(hourly_timestamps, config, occupancy_mode, now, setback_modifier, thermal_model, classification)` before iterating forecast hours (pre-computed, not per-hour — Issue #119 B3 fix).
- Sleep temperatures in the band are derived from `compute_bedtime_setback(config, thermal_model, classification)`, the same function used by `automation.py`. Chart band, physics prediction, and automation engine all use identical adaptive sleep setpoints when a model is available.
- Occupancy mode is propagated: away today → setback setpoints for today's hours only; vacation → deep setback for all forecast days.

When `thermal_model` or `classification` is absent, the band falls back to static sleep-temp defaults and the ramp interpolation path is used for the indoor prediction curve.

### `get_thermal_model() -> dict`

Returns the current accumulated thermal model from `thermal_model_cache`.

**Output dict structure (v3):**

```python
{
    # Core physics parameters
    "k_passive": float | None,              # envelope decay rate (hr⁻¹, negative)
    "k_active_heat": float | None,          # HVAC heating contribution (°F/hr, positive)
    "k_active_cool": float | None,          # HVAC cooling contribution (°F/hr, negative)
    "k_vent": float | None,                 # fan-only ventilation decay rate (hr⁻¹, negative)
    "k_vent_window": float | None,          # window-open ventilation decay rate (hr⁻¹, negative)
    "k_solar": float | None,               # solar gain coefficient (°F/hr per unit solar factor)
    # Confidence
    "confidence": str,                      # HVAC confidence: "none"|"low"|"medium"|"high" (heat+cool obs count)
    "confidence_k_passive": str,            # passive confidence: "none"|"low"|"medium"|"high" (passive obs count)
    "confidence_k_hvac": str,              # same as "confidence" — explicit alias
    # Observation counts
    "observation_count_heat": int,
    "observation_count_cool": int,
    "observation_count_total": int,
    "observation_count_passive": int,
    "observation_count_fan_only": int,
    "observation_count_vent": int,
    "observation_count_solar": int,
    # Legacy compatibility fields
    "heating_rate_f_per_hour": float | None,  # = abs(k_active_heat), rounded to 2dp
    "cooling_rate_f_per_hour": float | None,  # = abs(k_active_cool), rounded to 2dp
    # Diagnostics
    "avg_r_squared_passive": float | None,
    "last_observation_date": str | None,
}
```

`confidence` (HVAC) is graded by `observation_count_heat + observation_count_cool`: `"none"` (< 3), `"low"` (3–9), `"medium"` (10–19), `"high"` (20+).

`confidence_k_passive` is graded independently by `observation_count_passive`: same thresholds. Physics prediction activates when either confidence is > `"none"` — enabling prediction on homes with zero HVAC cycles recorded (passive-only households).

The legacy `heating_rate_f_per_hour` and `cooling_rate_f_per_hour` fields are kept for backward compatibility with `compute_bedtime_setback()` and `_compute_ramp_hours()`.

### `LearningState` Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pending_thermal_event` | `dict \| None` | Serialised in-progress HVAC event (legacy compat field; v3 also uses `coordinator._pending_observations` dict) |
| `thermal_model_cache` | `dict \| None` | EWMA-accumulated model parameters for all six observation types |

**Startup recovery:** On startup, the coordinator reads `pending_thermal_event` from `LearningState`. If an HVAC observation is in `post_heat` phase, it is restored to `_pending_observations` and monitoring continues. Active-phase HVAC observations are abandoned (cannot reliably resume an active HVAC session across a restart). Non-HVAC observations are not persisted and are simply restarted on the next poll if conditions hold.

### Sanity Bounds (from `const.py`)

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `THERMAL_K_PASSIVE_MIN` | `-0.5` hr⁻¹ | Minimum envelope decay rate (very leaky) |
| `THERMAL_K_PASSIVE_MAX` | `-0.001` hr⁻¹ | Maximum envelope decay rate (very well insulated) |
| `THERMAL_K_ACTIVE_HEAT_MIN` | `0.5` °F/hr | Minimum HVAC heating contribution |
| `THERMAL_K_ACTIVE_HEAT_MAX` | `15.0` °F/hr | Maximum HVAC heating contribution |
| `THERMAL_K_ACTIVE_COOL_MIN` | `-15.0` °F/hr | Maximum HVAC cooling contribution (magnitude) |
| `THERMAL_K_ACTIVE_COOL_MAX` | `-0.5` °F/hr | Minimum HVAC cooling contribution (magnitude) |

### `get_weather_bias() -> dict`

Analyzes historical records where both forecast and observed temperatures are present to detect systematic forecast error (the weather service consistently running warm or cool).

**Output dict structure:**

```python
{
    "high_bias": float,       # mean forecast high error in °F (positive = forecast runs warm)
    "low_bias": float,        # mean forecast low error in °F (positive = forecast runs warm)
    "confidence": str,        # "none" | "low" | "medium" | "high"
    "sample_count": int,      # number of days used to compute the bias
}
```

**Confidence levels:** same thresholds as `get_thermal_model()` (3/10/20 observations).

### Suggestion Keys for Thermal Learning

| Suggestion Key | Detection | Suggestion Text |
|---|---|---|
| `thermal_model_ready` | `get_thermal_model()` confidence transitions from `"none"` to `"low"` or better for both heat and cool | "Your home's thermal profile is ready. Bedtime setback depth and pre-heat timing are now tuned to your home's actual heating performance." |
| `forecast_bias_significant` | `get_weather_bias()` high or low bias magnitude exceeds 3°F at `"medium"` or higher confidence | "Your weather service appears to run [warm/cool] by about X°F on average. Climate Advisor has adjusted its timing calculations to compensate." |

### Sensor Attributes (Compliance Sensor)

The following attributes are added to `sensor.climate_advisor_comfort_score` when the thermal model is available:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `thermal_heating_rate` | `float \| None` | `k_active_heat` in user's configured unit per hour (`None` if no data) |
| `thermal_cooling_rate` | `float \| None` | `abs(k_active_cool)` in user's configured unit per hour (`None` if no data) |
| `thermal_confidence` | `str` | Confidence level: `"none"`, `"low"`, `"medium"`, or `"high"` |
| `thermal_observation_count` | `int` | Total heat + cool observations recorded |
| `forecast_high_bias` | `float` | Forecast high bias in user's configured unit (0.0 if no data) |
| `forecast_low_bias` | `float` | Forecast low bias in user's configured unit (0.0 if no data) |
| `forecast_bias_confidence` | `str` | Confidence level for weather bias estimate |

## Future Learning Capabilities (v0.3+)

### ~~Thermal Model Learning~~ _(Complete — see Thermal Model section above)_
~~Track how quickly the house heats/cools under different conditions to build a simple thermal model.~~ Implemented in Phase 5 (scalar rate model) and replaced with a two-parameter physics model in Issue #114 (`k_passive` + `k_active`). The thermal model drives adaptive bedtime setback depth, pre-heat start time, and the physics-based predicted temperature curve. Parameters are exposed via the compliance sensor.

### Seasonal Baselines
After a full year of data, establish seasonal baselines for runtime, comfort scores, and energy use. Detect anomalies (e.g., "Your heating runtime this November is 30% higher than last November — possible insulation issue or thermostat drift").

### Override Pattern Analysis
Instead of just counting overrides, analyze their direction and timing:
- "You consistently raise the temperature 2°F around 3pm" → suggest a scheduled bump
- "You lower the temperature every night before your usual bedtime" → suggest moving bedtime setback earlier

### Energy Cost Integration
With utility rate data, convert runtime minutes to estimated cost and show daily/weekly/monthly savings compared to "no automation" baseline.

## Configuration Changes Applied by Suggestions

| Suggestion Key | Config Changes |
|---------------|---------------|
| `low_window_compliance` | `disable_window_recommendations: true` |
| `frequent_overrides` | `request_setpoint_analysis: true` |
| `short_departures` | `occupancy_setback_minutes: 5` |
| `comfort_violations` | `setback_modifier: +2`, `morning_preheat_offset_minutes: 15` |
| `frequent_door_pauses` | `door_pause_seconds: 300` |
| `thermal_model_ready` | No config change — informational notification only |
| `forecast_bias_significant` | No config change — bias is applied internally at runtime |

## Compliance Summary API

The `get_compliance_summary()` method returns a dict suitable for sensor attributes:

```python
{
    "status": "active",            # or "collecting_data"
    "days_recorded": 28,
    "window_compliance": 0.35,     # 35% of recommended days
    "avg_daily_hvac_runtime_minutes": 145.5,
    "comfort_score": 0.92,         # 92% of time in comfort range
    "total_manual_overrides": 8,
    "pending_suggestions": 2,
}
```

### Metric Definitions

#### Comfort Violations (`comfort_violations_minutes`)
**Unit:** minutes
**What it means:** Time during the day when the indoor temperature was outside the configured
comfort range (`comfort_heat`–`comfort_cool` settings, default 70–75°F).
**How it accumulates:** The coordinator checks indoor temperature on every data update.
Each check adds the **actual elapsed time** since the previous check (capped at 30 minutes)
when the temperature is outside the comfort range. This prevents double-counting when the
coordinator is refreshed more frequently than the 30-minute scheduled interval (e.g., after
door/window events or automation revisits).
**Maximum per day:** 1440 minutes (24 hours). Values above 1440 in historical records
indicate data recorded before v0.2.x (fixed-30-min bug) and should be disregarded.

#### Comfort Score (`comfort_score`)
**Formula:** `1 − (sum of daily violation_minutes / (days_recorded × 1440))`
**Range:** 0.0 (always outside range) to 1.0 (always within range), reported as a percentage
**Example:** 3 days, total 2160 violation minutes → `1 − (2160 / 4320)` = 0.50 = 50%
**Sensor:** `sensor.climate_advisor_comfort_score` reports this as a percentage (0–100%)
**Trigger:** More than 5 days with over 30 violation minutes triggers the `comfort_violations`
suggestion, which reduces setback aggressiveness and starts morning pre-heat 15 minutes earlier.
