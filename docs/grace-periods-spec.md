# Grace Period State Machine — Territory Spec (Tier 3)

## Anchors

| Question | Short answer (≤2 sentences) | → Full answer |
|---|---|---|
| What triggers a manual grace period vs an automation grace period? | Manual grace starts after a user-initiated HVAC change (thermostat override during pause, fan manual change, or dashboard resume). Automation grace starts whenever Climate Advisor itself resumes HVAC after a door/window closes or after natural ventilation ends. | [§ Grace Period Types](#grace-period-types) |
| How long does each grace type last by default, and can it be configured? | Manual grace defaults to 1800 s (30 min); automation grace defaults to 300 s (5 min). Both durations are configurable via `manual_grace_seconds` and `automation_grace_seconds` in config; a value of 0 disables grace entirely. | [§ Grace Period Types](#grace-period-types) |
| What does an active grace period suppress? | A door or window opening during an active grace period does NOT pause HVAC (unless outdoor temperature is already cool enough to qualify for natural ventilation). | [§ Manual Grace — What It Suppresses](#manual-grace) |
| When a grace timer fires, what are the three possible outcomes? | (1) Within planned window period → clear grace silently. (2) A sensor is still open → clear grace flags, then schedule `_re_pause_for_open_sensor()`. (3) All sensors closed → clear grace flags, optionally send notification. | [§ Timer Lifecycle — Expiry Callback](#timer-lifecycle) |
| Is grace state persisted across HA restarts? | No. `restore_state()` explicitly sets `_grace_active = False` and `_last_resume_source = None`. Pause state (`_paused_by_door`, `_pre_pause_mode`) IS persisted. | [§ Pre-Pause Mode Storage — HA Restart](#pre-pause-mode-storage) |
| What happens to an active grace period when occupancy changes? | The engine has no explicit occupancy-triggered grace cancellation. Grace timers run to expiry regardless of occupancy transitions; occupancy handlers (`handle_occupancy_away`, `handle_occupancy_home`) do not call `_cancel_grace_timers()`. | [§ Occupancy Interaction](#occupancy-interaction) |

## Grace Period Types

### Manual Grace

**Trigger:** Any of three user-initiated events:
1. User manually changes the thermostat HVAC mode while `_paused_by_door = True` — detected by `_async_thermostat_changed()` in the coordinator; dispatches to `handle_manual_override_during_pause()` which calls `_start_grace_period("manual")`.
2. User manually changes fan state — `handle_fan_manual_override()` calls `_start_grace_period("manual")` directly.
3. User presses "Resume" on the dashboard — `resume_from_pause()` clears the pause and calls `_start_grace_period("manual")`.
4. A manual thermostat override is confirmed after the `CONF_OVERRIDE_CONFIRM_PERIOD` window — `_confirm_override()` calls `_start_grace_period("manual")`.

**Duration:** Configurable via `CONF_MANUAL_GRACE_PERIOD` (`manual_grace_seconds`). Default: `DEFAULT_MANUAL_GRACE_SECONDS = 1800` seconds (30 minutes). A configured value of 0 disables manual grace entirely (timer is not started, `_grace_active` remains `False`).

**What it suppresses:** During active manual grace, `handle_door_window_open()` checks `self._grace_active` early (L1053–L1066). If grace is active AND outdoor temperature is at or above `nat_vent_threshold` (i.e., outdoor is NOT cool enough for natural ventilation), the method returns immediately without pausing HVAC. If outdoor is cool enough for natural ventilation, execution falls through to the nat-vent path — grace does not suppress nat-vent activation.

**Notification:** Off by default (`CONF_MANUAL_GRACE_NOTIFY` defaults to `False`). Configurable to on.

**End condition:** Timer fires → `_grace_expired()` callback executes one of three branches (see [Timer Lifecycle](#timer-lifecycle)).

---

### Automation Grace (Window-Close Grace)

**Trigger:** Any of two Climate Advisor-initiated resumptions:
1. All monitored doors/windows transition to closed — `handle_all_doors_windows_closed()` restores `_pre_pause_mode`, calls `_start_grace_period("automation")` (L1231).
2. Natural ventilation ends because all sensors closed — after fan deactivation and HVAC mode restore, `_start_grace_period("automation")` is called (L1214).

**Duration:** Configurable via `CONF_AUTOMATION_GRACE_PERIOD` (`automation_grace_seconds`). Default: `DEFAULT_AUTOMATION_GRACE_SECONDS = 300` seconds (5 minutes). A configured value of 0 disables automation grace.

**What it suppresses:** Same early-return guard in `handle_door_window_open()` as manual grace. A door or window opening within 5 minutes of HVAC resumption does not re-pause the system (unless nat-vent conditions are met).

**Notification:** On by default (`CONF_AUTOMATION_GRACE_NOTIFY` defaults to `True`). Configurable to off.

**End condition:** Same three-branch expiry callback as manual grace.

## State Machine

The grace period state machine is embedded within the broader pause/resume lifecycle. States are represented by the combination of `_paused_by_door` and `_grace_active` flags. There is no named state enum in the code.

| From State | Event | To State | Side Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| NORMAL (`paused=F, grace=F`) | Door/window opens; stays open past debounce; HVAC was not off | PAUSED (`paused=T, grace=F`) | Store `_pre_pause_mode`; set HVAC off; send door-pause notification |
| NORMAL | Door/window opens; HVAC was already off | NORMAL (unchanged) | `_paused_by_door` set to True but no HVAC call needed; no grace started |
| NORMAL | Door/window opens during planned window period | NORMAL (unchanged) | No pause, no grace; sensor open is expected |
| PAUSED | All sensors close | GRACE (`paused=F, grace=T`) | Restore `_pre_pause_mode` via HVAC service call; restore comfort temp; start automation grace timer |
| PAUSED | User manually changes HVAC mode on thermostat (not automation-initiated) | GRACE (`paused=F, grace=T`) | Clear `_paused_by_door` and `_pre_pause_mode`; start manual grace; cancel all debounce timers |
| PAUSED | User presses "Resume" on dashboard | GRACE (`paused=F, grace=T`) | Clear pause; restore `_current_classification.hvac_mode` (not `_pre_pause_mode`); set `_resumed_from_pause=True`; start manual grace |
| GRACE | New door/window open (outdoor too warm for nat-vent) | GRACE (unchanged) | Suppressed — no re-pause, no new grace timer |
| GRACE | New door/window open (outdoor cool enough for nat-vent) | NAT_VENT (special: `paused=F, grace=T`, `_natural_vent_active=T`) | Falls through grace guard to nat-vent path; HVAC off, fan on |
| GRACE | Grace timer fires; within planned window period | NORMAL (`paused=F, grace=F`) | Clear grace flags silently; call `clear_manual_override()` |
| GRACE | Grace timer fires; sensor still open (`_sensor_check_callback()` returns True) | PAUSED (`paused=T, grace=F`) | Clear grace flags; schedule `_re_pause_for_open_sensor()`; emit `grace_expired` event with `re_paused=True` |
| GRACE | Grace timer fires; all sensors closed | NORMAL (`paused=F, grace=F`) | Clear grace flags; call `clear_manual_override()`; emit `grace_expired` event with `re_paused=False`; send notification if enabled |
| GRACE | `_cancel_grace_timers()` called (e.g., new grace replaces old) | NORMAL (`paused=F, grace=F`) | Cancel active timer; clear `_grace_active`, `_last_resume_source` |
| NORMAL | Fan manual override detected | GRACE (`paused=F, grace=T`) | Start manual grace (fan override path — HVAC pause not involved) |

**Note on concurrent manual and automation timers:** `_start_grace_period()` always calls `_cancel_grace_timers()` first (L1469). This means starting a new grace (of either type) unconditionally cancels any running timer. The engine cannot have both `_manual_grace_cancel` and `_automation_grace_cancel` active simultaneously — the second call to `_start_grace_period()` replaces the first. `_grace_active` therefore reflects the most recently started grace only.

---

## Pre-Pause Mode Storage

**What is stored:** `self._pre_pause_mode` stores the HVAC mode string (e.g., `"heat"`, `"cool"`) as read from `hass.states.get(self.climate_entity).state` at the moment the pause begins (L1164–L1166 in `handle_door_window_open()`).

**Pause guard:** If `_pre_pause_mode` is `None` or `"off"`, `_paused_by_door` is NOT set and HVAC is not touched (L1168). This prevents double-pausing on an already-off thermostat.

**Where stored:** In-memory on the `AutomationEngine` instance as `self._pre_pause_mode`. It is also included in `get_serializable_state()` (L2085) and therefore written to the persisted learning JSON on each state save.

**Restoration on door-close:** `handle_all_doors_windows_closed()` calls `_set_hvac_mode(self._pre_pause_mode, ...)` (L1222–L1224), then sets `_pre_pause_mode = None` (L1232). Comfort temperature is also restored via `_set_temperature_for_mode()`.

**Restoration on dashboard resume:** `resume_from_pause()` does NOT use `_pre_pause_mode`. It uses `_current_classification.hvac_mode` instead (L1449–L1456), because the classification may have changed since the pause was set. `_pre_pause_mode` is set to `None` at L1443.

**HA restart during PAUSED state:** `restore_state()` reads `paused_by_door` and `pre_pause_mode` from the persisted dict (L2044–L2045). Pause state survives restart. Grace timers do NOT survive restart — `_grace_active` is explicitly reset to `False` (L2068). The docstring at L2040–L2042 confirms: "Grace timers are cleared on restart (natural reset point)."

**HA restart during GRACE state:** Grace timer is lost. On next restart, `_grace_active = False`. If a sensor was still open, the next sensor event (or next 30-min poll via `check_natural_vent_conditions`) will re-evaluate and pause if needed.

---

## Invariants

Confirmed from code:

1. **Pre-pause mode is captured before any HVAC service call.** `handle_door_window_open()` reads `state.state` into `_pre_pause_mode` at L1165–L1166 before calling `_set_hvac_mode("off")` at L1172. The stored value reflects the mode that was active, not the mode after HVAC is turned off.

2. **Pause only occurs when HVAC was active.** The guard at L1168 (`if self._pre_pause_mode and self._pre_pause_mode != "off"`) prevents setting `_paused_by_door = True` when HVAC was already off. In that case no service call is made and `_paused_by_door` remains `False`.

3. **`_start_grace_period()` always replaces any running grace.** `_cancel_grace_timers()` is the first call inside `_start_grace_period()` (L1469). Starting grace twice in succession cancels the first timer and begins a fresh one. The two cancel handles (`_manual_grace_cancel`, `_automation_grace_cancel`) are mutually exclusive: each call to `_start_grace_period()` sets only one of them based on `source`.

4. **Grace suppresses new pauses but not natural ventilation.** The early-return in `handle_door_window_open()` at L1053–L1066 exits only when `outdoor >= nat_vent_threshold`. When outdoor is cool enough, execution falls through to the nat-vent evaluation path. Grace does not unconditionally suppress all sensor-open behavior.

5. **Grace state is not persisted across HA restarts.** `restore_state()` at L2067–L2069 unconditionally sets `_grace_active = False`. Only `_paused_by_door` and `_pre_pause_mode` survive restarts via the persisted state dict.

6. **Automation grace is always the source after a door-close resume; manual grace is always the source after a user action.** The `source` parameter passed to `_start_grace_period()` is hardcoded at each call site — `"automation"` in `handle_all_doors_windows_closed()` (L1214, L1231) and `"manual"` in `handle_manual_override_during_pause()` (L1426), `resume_from_pause()` (L1459), `handle_fan_manual_override()` (L1426), and `_confirm_override()` (L1651).

7. **Debounce timers are cancelled when a manual override is detected during pause.** `_cancel_all_debounce_timers()` is called in `_async_thermostat_changed()` at L1919, immediately after dispatching to `handle_manual_override_during_pause()`. This prevents orphaned debounce timers from re-triggering a pause after the user has manually resumed HVAC.

8. **`_resumed_from_pause` flag is set only by `resume_from_pause()` and cleared only by `clear_manual_override()`.** It is not set by `handle_all_doors_windows_closed()` (automatic resume) or by `handle_manual_override_during_pause()`. The flag drives the dashboard status string: `"resumed — door/window override"` vs `"grace period (automation|manual)"`.

9. **Invariant NOT confirmed (no code evidence found):** The spec prompt suggested verifying "Manual grace and automation grace cannot both be active simultaneously." The code does not maintain this as a named invariant — it falls out of the `_cancel_grace_timers()` call at the top of `_start_grace_period()`. If something calls `_start_grace_period("manual")` while automation grace is running, `_automation_grace_cancel()` is invoked and `_manual_grace_cancel` is set. The result is exclusive-at-a-time, but only because of the unconditional cancel, not an explicit guard.

---

## Timer Lifecycle

**Start:** `async_call_later(self.hass, duration, _grace_expired)` at L1540. Returns a cancel callable stored in either `_manual_grace_cancel` (source=`"manual"`) or `_automation_grace_cancel` (source=`"automation"`). `_grace_active` is set to `True` before the timer starts (L1481). `_grace_end_time` is set to an ISO timestamp of `now + duration` (L1483).

**Cancel:** `_cancel_grace_timers()` (L1550–L1559) invokes both cancel callables if present, then sets `_grace_active = False` and `_last_resume_source = None`. Called in:
- `_start_grace_period()` — beginning of every new grace (replaces previous timer)
- `cleanup()` — coordinator/engine teardown (L2120)
- Implicitly: any new call to `_start_grace_period()` cancels the previous via `_cancel_grace_timers()` at L1469

**Extend:** There is no explicit "extend" operation. A new `_start_grace_period()` call cancels the previous and starts a fresh full-duration timer. This is the effective extension mechanism, but it is not named or documented as such in code.

**Expiry callback name:** `_grace_expired` (inner closure defined at L1486). The `@callback` decorator marks it as a synchronous HA callback. It executes one of three branches:

| Branch | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Planned window | `_is_within_planned_window_period()` returns True | Clear grace flags silently; call `clear_manual_override()`; return |
| Re-pause | `_sensor_check_callback()` returns True (sensor still open) | Clear grace flags; call `clear_manual_override()`; schedule `_re_pause_for_open_sensor()` via `async_create_task`; emit `grace_expired` event with `re_paused=True` |
| Normal expiry | All sensors closed or no callback set | Clear grace flags; call `clear_manual_override()`; emit `grace_expired` event with `re_paused=False`; send notification if `should_notify` is True |

**`_re_pause_for_open_sensor()` (L1561–L1613):** Async method scheduled via `async_create_task`. Re-checks planned window period first (if within window, skips re-pause). Otherwise evaluates nat-vent conditions — if outdoor is cool enough for natural ventilation, activates nat-vent mode instead of re-pausing. Falls through to re-pause: captures `state.state` into `_pre_pause_mode`, sets `_paused_by_door = True`, calls HVAC off (unless already off), sends `grace_repause` notification.

**`_sensor_check_callback`:** Set by the coordinator after engine construction. Points to `coordinator._any_sensor_open()` which reads live HA sensor states for all `_resolved_sensors`. If `None` (e.g., in unit tests), the re-pause branch is skipped and grace expires normally.

---

## Pre-Pause Mode Storage

*(See also the invariants section above for the full storage contract.)*

**Serialized fields in `get_serializable_state()`:**
```
"paused_by_door": bool
"pre_pause_mode": str | None
"grace_active": bool
"last_resume_source": str | None
"grace_end_time": str | None  (ISO timestamp — informational, not used on restore)
```

**Fields restored in `restore_state()`:**
```
_paused_by_door   ← "paused_by_door"   (default: False)
_pre_pause_mode   ← "pre_pause_mode"   (default: None)
_grace_active     = False              (always reset)
_last_resume_source = None             (always reset)
```

`_grace_end_time` is NOT restored (stays as `None` after restart). This is consistent — without an active timer, the end time is meaningless.

---

## Occupancy Interaction

**Occupancy mode changes do not directly cancel or alter grace periods.** There are no calls to `_cancel_grace_timers()` or `_start_grace_period()` inside `handle_occupancy_away()`, `handle_occupancy_home()`, or `handle_occupancy_vacation()`. Grace timers run to natural expiry regardless of occupancy state changes during an active grace window.

**Away/vacation mode and pause:** If occupancy transitions to away or vacation while `_paused_by_door = True`, the pause flag persists. The occupancy handlers apply temperature setbacks to the thermostat (via `_set_temperature()`) but do not call `_set_hvac_mode()`, so HVAC remains off as it was during the pause. When sensors close and `handle_all_doors_windows_closed()` fires, `_pre_pause_mode` is restored to whatever mode was active when the pause began — which may now be inconsistent with the setback temp applied by the occupancy handler. There is no reconciliation step between pause restoration and current occupancy mode at the `handle_all_doors_windows_closed()` level. However, `_set_temperature_for_mode()` (called during resume) internally routes through occupancy-aware logic via `_set_temperature_for_mode()` — which checks `_occupancy_mode` and applies setback if away/vacation.

**Away mode and door-open suppression:** Away/vacation mode does not skip the debounce or pause flow. If HVAC is running in heat/cool mode while occupancy is away (e.g., pre-conditioning), a door opening will still trigger the debounce and potentially pause HVAC.

**Grace expiry during occupancy-away:** The `_grace_expired` callback does not read `_occupancy_mode`. All three branches (planned window, re-pause, normal expiry) execute the same logic regardless of current occupancy state.

## Error Conditions

### Door/Window Sensor Goes Unavailable During Grace

`_is_sensor_open()` in the coordinator (L916–L924) returns `False` when the sensor state is missing (`hass.states.get()` returns `None`) or the state string is not `"on"` (or `"off"` when polarity is inverted). An unavailable sensor appears closed. If all other sensors are closed and the unavailable sensor was the only one open, `handle_all_doors_windows_closed()` is not triggered by the sensor event (because the sensor never fires a `state_changed` event transitioning to `"off"` — it goes to `"unavailable"`). However, the coordinator's `_async_door_window_changed()` only fires on state change events. If the sensor goes unavailable without a prior close event, the system stays paused indefinitely until either: a manual resume, another sensor closes (triggering all-closed check), or an HA restart (which preserves pause state).

There is no polling path that periodically re-evaluates sensor states during a pause — the check only happens on state-change events and at the grace-expiry recheck.

### HA Restart During Grace

Grace timer is lost on restart. `restore_state()` sets `_grace_active = False`. If a door was still open when HA restarted, `_paused_by_door = True` and `_pre_pause_mode` are restored. The next sensor state-change event or coordinator poll re-enters the normal flow. The HVAC remains off (from the pre-restart pause) — no HVAC action happens until a sensor closes or the user manually resumes.

### HA Restart During PAUSED State

Pause state (`_paused_by_door = True`, `_pre_pause_mode = "<mode>"`) is persisted and restored. HVAC remains off. The engine re-enters PAUSED state immediately after restart with the correct pre-pause mode ready for restoration.

### Concurrent Door/Window Events (Multiple Sensors)

Each sensor gets its own debounce timer in `_door_open_timers` (keyed by `entity_id`). A second sensor opening while the first is in debounce starts a second independent timer. Both timers can fire and call `handle_door_window_open()` in sequence. The second call is a no-op because `_paused_by_door` is already `True` (early return at L1050–L1051).

On close: `handle_all_doors_windows_closed()` is only called when ALL monitored sensors are closed (L1871: `all_closed = all(not self._is_sensor_open(s) for s in self._resolved_sensors)`). Partial closes do not trigger resume.

### Pre-Pause Mode Is None When Sensor Opens

If `hass.states.get(self.climate_entity)` returns `None` (thermostat entity unavailable), `_pre_pause_mode` stays `None`. The guard at L1168 (`if self._pre_pause_mode and self._pre_pause_mode != "off"`) evaluates to `False`. `_paused_by_door` is NOT set and HVAC is not touched. No notification is sent. The sensor opening is effectively silently ignored in this case.
